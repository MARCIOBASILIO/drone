Abstract = {Smart policing refers to the use of advanced technologies such as
   artificial intelligence to enhance policing activities in terms of crime
   prevention or crime reduction. Artificial intelligence tools, including
   machine learning and natural language processing, have widespread
   applications across various fields, such as healthcare, business, and
   law enforcement. By means of these technologies, smart policing enables
   organizations to efficiently process and analyze large volumes of data.
   Some examples of smart policing applications are fingerprint detection,
   DNA matching, CCTV surveillance, and crime prediction. While artificial
   intelligence offers the potential to reduce human errors and biases, it
   is still essential to acknowledge that the algorithms reflect the data
   on which they are trained, which are inherently collected by human
   inputs. Considering the critical role of the police in ensuring public
   safety, the adoption of these algorithms demands careful and thoughtful
   implementation. This paper presents a systematic literature review
   focused on exploring the machine learning techniques employed by law
   enforcement agencies. It aims to shed light on the benefits and
   limitations of utilizing these techniques in smart policing and provide
   insights into the effectiveness and challenges associated with the
   integration of machine learning in law enforcement practices.},

Abstract = {Authorship Attribution (AA) approaches in Natural Language Processing
   (NLP) are important in various domains, including forensic analysis and
   cybercrime. However, they pose Ethical, Legal, and Societal
   Implications/Aspects (ELSI/ELSA) challenges that remain underexplored.
   Inspired by foundational AI ethics guidelines and frameworks, this
   research introduces a comprehensive framework of responsible guidelines
   that focuses on AA tasks in NLP, which are tailored to different
   stakeholders and development phases. These guidelines are structured
   around four core principles: privacy and data protection, fairness and
   non-discrimination, transparency and explainability, and societal
   impact. Furthermore, to illustrate a practical application of our
   guidelines, we apply them to a recent AA study that targets identifying
   and linking potential human trafficking vendors. We believe the proposed
   guidelines can assist researchers and practitioners in justifying their
   decisions, assisting ethical committees in promoting responsible
   practices, and identifying ethical concerns related to NLP-based AA
   approaches. Our study aims to contribute to ensuring the responsible
   development and deployment of AA tools.},

Abstract = {Data derived from the realm of the social sciences is often produced in
   digital text form, which motivates its use as a source for natural
   language processing methods. Researchers and practitioners have
   developed and relied on artificial intelligence techniques to collect,
   process, and analyze documents in the legal field, especially for tasks
   such as text summarization and classification. While increasing
   procedural efficiency is often the primary motivation behind natural
   language processing in the field, several works have proposed solutions
   for human rights-related issues, such as assessment of public policy and
   institutional social settings. One such issue is the presence of gender
   biases in court decisions, which has been largely studied in social
   sciences fields; biased institutional responses to gender-based violence
   are a violation of international human rights dispositions since they
   prevent gender minorities from accessing rights and hamper their
   dignity. Natural language processing-based approaches can help detect
   these biases on a larger scale. Still, the development and use of such
   tools require researchers and practitioners to be mindful of legal and
   ethical aspects concerning data sharing and use, reproducibility, domain
   expertise, and value-charged choices. In this work, we (a) present an
   experimental framework developed to automatically detect gender biases
   in court decisions issued in Brazilian Portuguese and (b) describe and
   elaborate on features we identify to be critical in such a technology,
   given its proposed use as a support tool for research and assessment of
   court activity.},

Title = {Analyzing Fairness of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing
   Models},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) algorithms play a critical role in decision-making
   across various domains, such as healthcare, finance, education, and law
   enforcement. However, concerns about fairness and bias in these systems
   have raised significant ethical and social challenges. To address these
   challenges, this research utilizes two prominent fairness libraries,
   Fairlearn by Microsoft and AIF360 by IBM. These libraries offer
   comprehensive frameworks for fairness analysis, providing tools to
   evaluate fairness metrics, visualize results, and implement bias
   mitigation algorithms. The study focuses on assessing and mitigating
   biases for unstructured datasets using Computer Vision (CV) and Natural
   Language Processing (NLP) models. The primary objective is to present a
   comparative analysis of the performance of mitigation algorithms from
   the two fairness libraries. This analysis involves applying the
   algorithms individually, one at a time, in one of the stages of the ML
   lifecycle, pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing, as well as
   sequentially across more than one stage. The results reveal that some
   sequential applications improve the performance of mitigation algorithms
   by effectively reducing bias while maintaining the model's performance.
   Publicly available datasets from Kaggle were chosen for this research,
   providing a practical context for evaluating fairness in real-world
   machine learning workflows.},

Abstract = {Misidentification and misreporting of hate crimes by victims and law
   enforcement are significant barriers to accurate data collection of hate
   crimes, and their consequent study and prevention. The use of machine
   learning in crime detection can improve the accuracy and speed at which
   reported incidents with bias elements are identified. This study
   develops a machine learning classifier that categorizes police reports
   as either events with bias elements or events with no bias elements. We
   use incident/offense reports from the Seattle Police Department to train
   a Natural Language Processing classification algorithm. We collect
   narratives, location data, and victim and suspect demographics to use as
   features. We evaluate the performance of logistic regression, random
   forest, and XGBoost algorithms, as well as several text embedding
   techniques. Despite substantial class imbalance, our model achieves a
   macro F1-score of 0.79, demonstrating the benefits of applied machine
   learning in accurately detecting and reporting hate crimes.},

Abstract = {The Portuguese Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality advocates
   that equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the
   Portuguese Constitution. While court decisions should reflect this
   principle, a preliminary analysis in cases of gender violence reveals
   that this is not always the case. Based on the extensive literature on
   subjectivity, modality and bias in Linguistics and in tandem with AI and
   Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the research proposed in
   this paper aims to study the linguistic formulations that convey bias in
   court decisions. The goal is to develop a linguistic model and,
   subsequently, a tool to automatically detect gender bias in this text
   genre. A corpus of a set of legal sentences on gender violence has been
   extracted from the public access database of the Portuguese Ministry of
   Justice (IGFEJ), which can be subject to a manual annotation process
   according to a typology of biased categories and structures. By
   exploiting the corpus in a supervised machine learning approach while
   following the most recent advances in NLP, we aim to deliver the
   aforementioned tool for biased language detection.},

Abstract = {Bias in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a critical and timely issue due
   to its sociological, economic and legal impact, as decisions made by
   biased algorithms could lead to unfair treatment of specific individuals
   or groups. Multiple surveys have emerged to provide a multidisciplinary
   view of bias or to review bias in specific areas such as social
   sciences, business research, criminal justice, or data mining. Given the
   ability of Semantic Web (SW) technologies to support multiple AI
   systems, we review the extent to which semantics can be a ``tool{''} to
   address bias in different algorithmic scenarios. We provide an in-depth
   categorisation and analysis of bias assessment, representation, and
   mitigation approaches that use SW technologies. We discuss their
   potential in dealing with issues such as representing disparities of
   specific demographics or reducing data drifts, sparsity, and missing
   values. We find research works on AI bias that apply semantics mainly in
   information retrieval, recommendation and natural language processing
   applications and argue through multiple use cases that semantics can
   help deal with technical, sociological, and psychological challenges.},

Abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence in legal analysis represents a
   significant transformation process in modern legal practices. The
   literature review showed that the number of studies on Turkish court
   decisions was limited, and only classification applications were
   developed. This study aims to summarize, predict, and analyze the
   Turkish Constitutional Court's decision texts. In this context, first a
   new, unique dataset was created. The dataset included class labels,
   original court decision texts, and summary court decision texts created
   by expert lawyers. Then, a hybrid summary model was established,
   combining extractive and abstract summarization to summarize long court
   decisions automatically. With this model, the summarization efficiency
   was increased, and the token limitation problem common in existing
   transformative models was eliminated. The model showed good performance
   for summarization by obtaining Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L scores of
   0.6129, 0.5884, and 0.5891 respectively. After the summarization phase,
   the Legal Judgment Prediction applications were developed. Separate
   classification models were developed for court decision texts and
   summary court decision texts, obtained using the hybrid model. When the
   models were compared, the XGBoost model achieved the best performance in
   legal judgment prediction tasks, with an accuracy rate of 93.84\% for
   full texts and 62.30\% for summary texts. In the final stage of the
   study, the model results were explained using the SHapley Additive
   exPlanations method. The findings of this study emphasize the
   superiority of hybrid approaches to legal document analysis. They
   highlighted the vital role of explainable techniques in improving
   transparency and reliability in legal processes.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and its related policies (e.g., stay at home and
   social distancing orders) have increased people's use of digital
   technology, such as social media. Researchers have, in turn, utilized
   artificial intelligence to analyze social media data for public health
   surveillance. For example, through machine learning and natural language
   processing, they have monitored social media data to examine public
   knowledge and behavior. This paper explores the ethical considerations
   of using artificial intelligence to monitor social media to understand
   the public's perspectives and behaviors surrounding COVID-19, including
   potential risks and benefits of an AI-driven approach. Importantly,
   investigators and ethics committees have a role in ensuring that
   researchers adhere to ethical principles of respect for persons,
   beneficence, and justice in a way that moves science forward while
   ensuring public safety and confidence in the process.},

Abstract = {In today's world, an increasing number of decisions are being affected
   by machine learning (ML) algorithms in critical contexts ranging from
   banking to healthcare, recruitment, education, and criminal justice.
   Since ensuring fair and unbiased outcomes in these contexts is
   imperative, a large body of recent work has focused on bias and fairness
   in ML. In this paper, we consider the trust, privacy, and security
   aspects of bias and fairness in ML. From the trust aspect, we argue that
   for fairness measurements to be robust and trusted, a diverse set of
   fairness metrics should be consulted, and the agreements and
   disagreements between them should be well-understood. Upon conducting an
   empirical study with ten fairness metrics, three datasets, and three
   correlation notions, we identify fairness metrics that are positively
   correlated, negatively correlated, and uncorrelated by nature. From the
   privacy aspect, we investigate the impact of differential privacy (DP)
   on ML models and find that current differentially private ML mechanisms
   suffer from two drawbacks: reduced accuracy and increased bias. From the
   security aspect, we propose a backdoor attack to inject bias into NLP
   models. Upon experimentally testing our attack, we observe that modern
   transformer-based NLP models (such as BERT and RoBERTa) are more
   vulnerable to our attack, our attack is able to remain stealthy, and it
   can generalize to dynamic (changing) triggers presented at test time.
   Overall, our work highlights the intersections between two research
   directions that are often studied independently: (i) trust, privacy, and
   security in ML, and (ii) bias and fairness in ML.},

   but have not been utilized to classify long documents of several
   domains. In addition, transformer models are also often pre-trained on
   generalized languages, making them less effective in language-specific
   domains, such as legal documents. In the natural language processing
   (NLP) domain, there is a growing interest in creating newer models that
   can handle more complex input sequences and domain-specific languages.
   Keeping the power of NLP in mind, this study proposes a legal
   documentation classifier that classifies the legal document by using the
   sliding window approach to increase the maximum sequence length of the
   model. We used the ECHR (European Court of Human Rights) publicly
   available dataset which to a large extent is imbalanced. Therefore, to
   balance the dataset we have scrapped the case articles from the web and
   extracted the data. Then, we employed conventional machine learning
   techniques such as SVM, DT, NB, AdaBoost, and transformer-based neural
   networks models including BERT, Legal-BERT, RoBERTa, BigBird, ELECTRA,
   and XLNet for the classification task. The experimental findings show
   that RoBERTa outperformed all the mentioned BERT versions by obtaining
   precision, recall, and F1-score of 89.1\%, 86.2\%, and 86.7\%,
   respectively. While from conventional machine learning techniques,
   AdaBoost outclasses SVM, DT, and NB by achieving scores of 81.9\%,
   81.5\%, and 81.7\% for precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and law is an AI research area that has a
   history spanning more than 50 years. In the early stages, several
   legal-expert systems were developed. Legal-expert systems are tools
   designed to realize fair judgments in court. In addition to this
   research, as information and communication technologies and AI
   technologies have progressed, AI and law has broadened its view from
   legal-expert systems to legal analytics and, recently, a lot of
   machinelearning and text-processing techniques have been employed to
   analyze legal information. The research trends are the same in Japan as
   well and not only people involved with legal-expert systems, but also
   those involved with natural language processing as well as lawyers have
   become interested in AI and law. This report introduces the history of
   and the research activities on applying AI to the legal domain in Japan.},

Abstract = {This article draws on an artificial intelligence (AI) technique to
   predict whether an individual application regarding the Turkish
   Constitutional Court's public morality and freedom of expression cases
   leding to a ``violation{''} or a ``nonviolation{''} decision. To this
   end, four different data sets have been composed, preclassification and
   fundamental word embeddings steps have been made on each data set.
   Multilayer perceptron, which is based on artificial neural networks, has
   been used for the prediction of the case decisions. We have predicted
   the court's decisions on these cases with the high success rates
   (average accuracy of 90\%) by using the subject or reasoning sections of
   texts of the cases as data. The subject section of the cases
   constituting only a very small part of the data has yielded the highest
   accuracy. The article has demonstrated that a basic AI technique can be
   successful in achieving accurate predictions even with relatively small
   data sets derived from well-structured court rulings.},

Abstract = {The digitization of legal texts and advances in artificial intelligence,
   natural language processing, text mining, network analysis, and machine
   learning have led to new forms of legal analysis by lawyers and law
   scholars. This article provides an overview of how computational methods
   are affecting research across the varied landscape of legal scholarship,
   from the interpretation of legal texts to the quantitative estimation of
   causal factors that shape the law. As computational tools continue to
   penetrate legal scholarship, they allow scholars to gain traction on
   traditional research questions and may engender entirely new research
   programs. Already, computational methods have facilitated important
   contributions in a diverse array of law-related research areas. As these
   tools continue to advance, and law scholars become more familiar with
   their potential applications, the impact of computational methods is
   likely to continue to grow.},

Abstract = {Law is one of the knowledge domains that are most reliant on textual
   material. Nowadays, however, it is very difficult and time-consuming for
   legal professionals to read, understand, and analyze all the available
   documents, due to the vast volume of case law that is published every
   day. In this age of legal big data, and with the increased availability
   of legal text online, many researchers have given more focus to the
   development of legal intelligent systems and applications. These
   intelligent systems can provide great services and solve many problems
   in legal domain. Over the last years, researchers have focused on
   predicting judicial case outcomes using Natural Language Processing
   (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) methods over case documents. Thus, Legal
   Judgment Prediction (LJP) is the task of automatically predicting the
   outcome of a court case given only the text of the case. To the best of
   our knowledge, no prior research with this intention has been conducted
   in English for appeal courts in Canada, as of 2021. The NLP application
   to legal judgments, that our proposed methodology focuses on, is to
   predict the outcomes of cases by looking only at the description of
   cases written by the court. Because appeal court decisions are often
   binary, as in accept or reject, the task is defined as a binary
   classification problem between `Allow' and `Dismiss'. This is the
   general approach in the literature as well. We employ various
   classification methods including classical classifiers, Deep Learning
   (DL) models, and compare their performances. Our best results are
   obtained using DL models with accuracy values reaching 93.46\% and
   F1-scores reaching 0.92, which are on par with the best results in the
   literature. Through this study, we hope to establish the basis for
   future research on the legal system of Canada and offer a baseline for
   future work.},

Abstract = {The Indian court system generates huge amounts of data relating to
   administration, pleadings, litigant behaviour, and court decisions on a
   regular basis. But the existing Judiciary is incapable of managing these
   vast troves of data efficiently that causes delays and pendency of a
   large volume of cases in the courts. Some of these time-consuming tasks
   involve case briefing, examining the legal issues, facts, legal
   principles, observations, and other significant aspects submitted by the
   contending parties in the court. In other words, computational methods
   to understand the underlying structure of a case document will directly
   aid the lawyers to perform these tasks efficiently and improve the
   overall efficiency of the Justice delivery system. Application of
   Computational techniques (such as Natural Language Processing) can help
   to gather and sift through these vast troves of information, identify
   patterns, extract the document structure, draft documents and make the
   information available online.
   Traditionally lawyers are trained to examine cases using the Case Law
   Analysis approach for case briefing. In this article, the authors aim to
   establish the importance and relevance of the automated case analysis
   problem in the legal domain. They introduce a novel case analysis
   structure for the supreme court judgment documents and define twelve
   different case law labels that are used by legal professionals to
   identify the structure. Finally the authors propose a method for
   automated case analysis, which will directly aid the lawyers to prepare
   speedy and efficient case briefs and drastically reduce the time taken
   by them in litigation.},

Abstract = {In common law jurisdictions, legal professionals cite facts and legal
   principles from precedent cases to support their arguments before the
   court for their intended outcome in a current case. This practice stems
   from the doctrine of stare decisis, where cases that have similar facts
   should receive similar decisions with respect to the principles. It is
   essential for legal professionals to identify such facts and principles
   in precedent cases, though this is a highly time intensive task. In this
   paper, we present studies that demonstrate that human annotators can
   achieve reasonable agreement on which sentences in legal judgements
   contain cited facts and principles (respectively, kappa = 0.65 and kappa
   = 0.95 for inter-and intra-annotator agreement). We further demonstrate
   that it is feasible to automatically annotate sentences containing such
   legal facts and principles in a supervised machine learning framework
   based on linguistic features, reporting per category precision and
   recall figures of between 0.79 and 0.89 for classifying sentences in
   legal judgements as cited facts, principles or neither using a Bayesian
   classifier, with an overall kappa of 0.72 with the human-annotated gold
   standard.},

Abstract = {Prostitution has been a topic of study for decades, yet many questions
   remain about where prostitution occurs. Difficulty in identifying
   prostitution activity is often attributed to the hidden and seemingly
   victimless nature of the crime. Despite numerous challenges associated
   with policing street prostitution, these encounters become more
   difficult to identify when they take place indoors, especially in
   locations away from public view, such as hotels. The purpose of this
   paper is to develop a strategy for identifying hotel facilities and
   surrounding areas that may be experiencing elevated levels of
   prostitution activity using high-volume, user-generated data, namely
   hotel reviews written by guests and posted to Travelocity.com. A unique
   synthesis of methods including data mining, natural language processing,
   machine learning, and basic spatial analysis are combined to identify
   facilities that may require additional law enforcement resources and/or
   social/health service outreach. Prostitution hotspots are identified
   within the city of Phoenix, Arizona and policy implications are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Court judgments contain valuable information on how statutory laws and
   past court precedents are interpreted and how the interdependence
   structure among them evolves in the courtroom. Data-mining the evolving
   structure of such customs and norms that reflect myriad social values
   from a large-scale court judgment corpus is an essential task from both
   the academic and industrial perspectives. In this paper, using data from
   approximately 110,000 court judgments from Japan spanning the period
   1998-2018 from the district to the supreme court level, we propose two
   tasks that grasp such a structure from court judgments and highlight the
   strengths and weaknesses of major machine learning models. One is a
   prediction task based on masked language modeling that connects textual
   information to legal codes and past court precedents. Another is a
   dynamic link prediction task where we predict the hidden interdependence
   structure in the law. We make quantitative and qualitative comparisons
   among major machine learning models to obtain insights for future
   developments.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the task of automatically identifying
   legally binding principles, known as ratio decidendi or just ratio, from
   transcripts of court judgements, also called case law or just cases.
   After briefly reviewing the relevant definitions and previous work in
   the area, we present a novel system for automatically extracting ratio
   from cases using a combination of natural language processing and
   machine learning. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that the ratio
   of a given case can be reliably obtained by identifying statements of
   legal principles in paragraphs that are cited by subsequent cases. Our
   method differs from related recent work by extracting principles from
   the text of the cited paragraphs (in the given case) as opposed to the
   text of the citing paragraphs (in a subsequent case). We conduct our own
   independent small-scale annotation study which reveals that this
   seemingly subtle shift of focus substantially increases reliability of
   finding the ratio. Then, by building on previous work in the automatic
   detection of legal principles and cross citations, we present a fully
   automated system that successfully identifies the ratio (in our study)
   with an accuracy of 72\%.},

Abstract = {Predictive policing is considered a high-stake context, where the main
   challenges in employing an AI solution are to ensure the privacy and
   fairness of the system while preserving high performance. This usually
   implies specific demands on the technologies used and their
   explainability. To alleviate the emerging impediments to adopt a
   recidivism model, this study exploresan approach employing synthetic
   data in combination with state-of-the-art NLP techniques, such as
   transformers-based models running locally. This approach enhances the
   representation of crimes while preserving data privacy. In particular,
   we focus on comparing several language models for multilabel
   classification in Spanish language and techniques such as data
   reduction, data augmentation and in-distribution validation. The
   resulting methodology shows the benefits and drawbacks of selecting each
   language model and highlights the ability of identify and alleviate
   populations where the model performs significantly worse than the
   average.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Since 2005, female firearm suicide rates increased by
   34\%, outpacing the rise in male firearm suicide rates over the same
   period. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a
   natural language processing pipeline to identify a select set of common
   and important circumstan-ces preceding female firearm suicide from
   coroner/medical examiner and law enforcement narratives.Methods:
   Unstructured information from coroner/medical examiner and law
   enforcement narra-tives were manually coded for 1,462 randomly selected
   cases from the National Violent Death Reporting System. Decedents were
   included from 40 states and Puerto Rico from 2014 to 2018. Naive Bayes,
   Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting classifier
   models were tuned using 5-fold cross-validation. Model performance was
   assessed using sensitivity, speci-ficity, positive predictive value, F1,
   and other metrics. Analyses were conducted from February to November
   2022.Results: The natural language processing pipeline performed well in
   identifying recent interper-sonal disputes, problems with intimate
   partners, acute/chronic pain, and intimate partners and immediate family
   at the scene. For example, the Support Vector Machine model had a mean
   of 98.1\% specificity and 90.5\% positive predictive value in
   classifying a recent interpersonal dispute before suicide. The Gradient
   Boosting model had a mean of 98.7\% specificity and 93.2\% positive
   predictive value in classifying a recent interpersonal dispute before
   suicide.Conclusions: This study developed a natural language processing
   pipeline to classify 5 female fire-arm suicide antecedents using
   narrative reports from the National Violent Death Reporting System,
   which may improve the examination of these circumstances. Practitioners
   and researchers should weigh the efficiency of natural language
   processing pipeline development against conventional text mining and
   manual review. Am J Prev Med 2023;65(2):278-285.\& COPY; 2023 American

Abstract = {The Regie du Logement du Quebec (RDL) is a tribunal with exclusive
   jurisdiction in matters regarding rental leases. Within the framework of
   the ACT (Autonomy Through Cyberjustice Technologies) project, we
   processed an original collection of court decisions in French and
   performed a thorough analysis to reveal biases that may influence
   prediction experiments. We studied a multilabel classification task that
   consists in predicting the types of verdict in order to illustrate the
   importance of prior data analysis. Our best model, based on the F1auBERT
   language model, achieves F1 score micro averages of 93.7\% and 84.9\% in
   Landlord v. Tenant and Tenant v. Landlord cases respectively. However,
   with the support of our in-depth analysis, we emphasize that these
   results should be kept in perspective and that some metrics may not be
   suitable for evaluating systems in sensitive domains such as housing
   law.},

Abstract = {Fake news is news-like content that has been produced without following
   journalism principles. Fake news try to mimic the look and feel of real
   news to intentionally disinform the reader. This phenomenon can have a
   strong influence on society, thus being potentially a severe problem. To
   address this phenomenon, systems to detect fake news have been
   developed, but most of them build upon fact-checking approaches, which
   are unfit to detect misinformation when a news piece, rather than
   completely false, is distorted, exaggerated, or even decontextualized.
   We aim to detect Portuguese fake news by following a forensic
   linguistics approach. Contrary to previous approaches, we build upon
   methods of linguistic and stylistic analysis that have been tried and
   tested in forensic linguists. After collecting corpora from multiple
   fake news outlets and from a genuine news source, we formulate the task
   as a text classification problem and demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed features when training different classifiers for telling
   fake from genuine news. Furthermore, we perform an ablation study with
   subsets of features and find that the proposed feature sets are
   complementary. The highest results reported are very promising,
   achieving 97\% of accuracy and a macro F1-score of 91\%.},

Abstract = {In a court document, the rhetorical status of a sentence conveys the
   intention of the sentence, whether is is a claim or contains supporting
   evidences, thus, is beneficial to court document processing systems, for
   example, court document retrieval systems. Besides, rhetorical structure
   analysis has high-impact applications in natural language processing,
   for instances, text summarization, sentiment analysis, question
   answering. The output structures of the analysis contain high-level
   relationship between clauses and so provides valuable information.
   Despite of a wide range of applications and the necessity for automatic
   court document processing, automatic rhetorical structure analysis has
   not been well noticed in the legal domain. We propose to use deep
   learning models for tackling the task of recognizing the rhetorical
   status of each sentence in a court document. Deep learning has been
   shown effective towards natural language processing tasks including
   discourse analysis. We have achieved promising results for the task,
   which suggests the applicability of artificial neural module embedding
   rhetorical information for other tasks, for example, summarization and
   information retrieval.},

Abstract = {Within the last decade text mining, i.e., extracting sensitive
   information from text corpora, has become a major factor in business
   intelligence. The automated textual analysis of law corpora is highly
   valuable because of its impact on a company's legal options and the raw
   amount of available jurisdiction. The study of supreme court
   jurisdiction and international law corpora is equally important due to
   its effects on business sectors.
   In this paper we use text mining methods to investigate Austrian supreme
   administrative court jurisdictions concerning dues and taxes. We analyze
   the law corpora using R with the new text mining package tm.
   Applications include clustering the jurisdiction documents into groups
   modeling tax classes (like income or value-added tax) and identifying
   jurisdiction properties. The findings are compared to results obtained
   by law experts.},

Abstract = {Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform
   high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education,
   and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine
   learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are
   not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by
   documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this
   paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage
   such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents
   accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked
   evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different
   cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic
   location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type {[}15]) and intersectional groups
   (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant
   to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the
   context in which models are intended to be used, details of the
   performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While
   we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the
   application fields of computer vision and natural language processing,
   this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning
   model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised
   models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained
   to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step
   towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related
   artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how
   well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work
   encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany
   model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other
   relevant documentation.},

Title = {LegalReasoner: A Multi-Stage Framework for Legal Judgment Prediction via
   Large Language Models and Knowledge Integration},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {166843-166854},
Abstract = {Legal judgment prediction (LJP) presents a formidable challenge in
   artificial intelligence, demanding intricate comprehension of legal
   texts, nuanced interpretation of statutes, and complex reasoning over
   multifaceted case elements. While recent advancements in natural
   language processing have shown promise, existing approaches often
   struggle to capture the sophisticated interplay between facts, legal
   principles, and precedents that characterize legal decision-making. This
   paper introduces LegalReasoner, a novel multi-stage framework that
   leverages large language models (LLMs) and integrates domain-specific
   knowledge for enhanced legal judgment prediction. Our approach
   encompasses four key stages: 1) legal knowledge infusion, where we
   pre-train an LLM on a vast corpus of legal literature using contrastive
   learning techniques; 2) case-law retrieval, employing a graph neural
   network to identify relevant precedents and statutes; 3) multi-hop
   reasoning, utilizing a transformer-based architecture with a
   hierarchical attention mechanism to navigate complex legal arguments;
   and 4) judgment synthesis, where we employ a generative adversarial
   network to produce coherent and legally sound judgments. We evaluate
   LegalReasoner on two diverse datasets: the European Court of Human
   Rights (ECHR) cases and the Chinese AI and Law Challenge (CAIL2018). Our
   framework demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art
   baselines, achieving an average accuracy increase of 7.8\% across all
   datasets. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies and
   interpretability analyses to elucidate the contributions of each
   component and provide insights into the model's decision-making process.
   Our work not only advances the field of automated legal reasoning but
   also offers a transparent and explainable system that could serve as a
   valuable tool for legal professionals. By bridging the gap between AI
   and legal expertise, LegalReasoner paves the way for more efficient,
   consistent, and fair legal decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {In the legal domain, documents of various types are created in
   connection with a case. Some are transcripts prepared by court
   reporters, based on notes taken during the proceedings of a trial or
   deposition. For example, deposition transcripts capture the
   conversations between attorneys and deponents. These documents are
   mostly in the form of question-answer (QA) pairs. Summarizing the
   information contained in these documents is a challenge for attorneys
   and paralegals because of their length and form. Having automated
   methods to convert a QA pair into a canonical form could aid with the
   extraction of insights from depositions. These insights could be in the
   form of a short summary, a list of key facts, a set of answers to
   specific questions, or a similar result from text processing of these
   documents. In this paper, we describe methods using NLP and Deep
   Learning techniques to transform such QA pairs into a canonical form.
   The resulting transformed documents can be used for summarization and
   other downstream tasks.},

Abstract = {The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened up new
   possibilities for various natural language processing tasks. This study
   explores the potential of LLMs for author profiling in digital text
   forensics, which involves identifying characteristics such as age and
   gender from writing style-a crucial task in forensic investigations of
   anonymous or pseudonymous communications. Experiments were conducted
   using state-of-the-art LLMs, including Polyglot, EEVE, and Bllossom, to
   evaluate their performance in author profiling. Different fine-tuning
   strategies, such as full fine-tuning, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and
   Quantized LoRA (QLoRA), were compared to determine the most effective
   methods for adapting LLMs to the specific needs of this task. The
   results show that fine-tuned LLMs can effectively predict authors' age
   and gender based on their writing styles, with Polyglot-based models
   generally outperforming EEVE and Bllossom models. Additionally, LoRA and
   QLoRA strategies significantly reduce computational costs and memory
   requirements while maintaining performance comparable to full
   fine-tuning. However, error analysis reveals limitations in the current
   LLM-based approach, including difficulty in capturing subtle linguistic
   variations across age groups and potential biases from pre-training
   data. These challenges are discussed and future research directions to
   address them are proposed. This study underscores the potential of LLMs
   in author profiling for digital text forensics, suggesting promising
   avenues for further exploration and refinement.},

Abstract = {Divorce is the legal dissolution of a marriage by a court. Since this is
   usually an unpleasant outcome of a marital union, each party may have
   reasons to call the decision to quit which is generally documented in
   detail in the court proceedings. Via a substantial corpus of 17,306
   court proceedings, this paper investigates gender inequality through the
   lens of divorce court proceedings. While emerging data sources (e.g.,
   public court records) on sensitive societal issues hold promise in
   aiding social science research, biases present in cutting-edge natural
   language processing (NLP) methods may interfere with or affect such
   studies. We thus require a thorough analysis of potential gaps and
   limitations present in extant NLP resources. In this paper, on the
   methodological side, we demonstrate that existing NLP resources required
   several non-trivial modifications to quantify societal inequalities. On
   the substantive side, we find that while a large number of court cases
   perhaps suggest changing norms in India where women are increasingly
   challenging patriarchy, AI-powered analyses of these court proceedings
   indicate striking gender inequality with women often subjected to
   domestic violence.},

Abstract = {This article presents a part of the ongoing Economic and Social Research
   Council (ESRC)-funded project ``FloraGuard: Tackling the illegal trade
   in endangered plants{''} that relies on cross-disciplinary approaches to
   analyze online marketplaces for the illegal trade in endangered plants,
   and explores strategies to develop digital resources to assist law
   enforcement in countering and disrupting this criminal market. This
   contribution focuses on how the project brought together computer
   science, criminology, conservation science, and law enforcement
   expertise to create a tool for the automatic gathering of relevant
   online information to be used for research, intelligence, and
   investigative purposes. The article also discusses the ethical standards
   applied and proposes the concept of ``artificial intelligence (AI)
   review{''} to provide a sociotechnical solution that builds
   trustworthiness in the AI approaches used for this type of
   cross-disciplinary information and communications technology
   (ICT)-enabled methodology.},

Title = {Extracting value from Brazilian Court decisions},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {106},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We propose a methodology to extract value from Brazilian Court decisions
   to support judges and lawyers in their decision-making. We instantiate
   our methodology in one information system we have developed. Such system
   (i) extracts plaintiff's legal claims and each specific provision on
   legal opinions enacted by lower and Appellate Courts, and (ii) connects
   each legal claim with the corresponding judicial provision. The
   information system presents the results through visualizations.
   Information Extraction for legal texts has been previously approached in
   the literature for different languages, using different methods. Our
   proposal is different from previous work, since our corpora comprise
   Brazilian lower and Appellate Court decisions, in which we look for a
   set of plaintiff's legal claims and judicial provisions commonly judged
   by the Court. We use the following methods to tackle the information
   extraction tasks: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network;
   Conditional Random Fields; and a combination of Bidirectional Long
   Short-Term Memory network and Conditional Random Fields. In addition to
   the well-known distributed representation of words in word embeddings,
   we use character-level representation of words in character embeddings.
   We have built three corpora - Kauane Insurance Report, Kauane Insurance
   Lower, and Kauane Insurance Upper - to train and evaluate the system,
   using public data from the State Court of Rio de Janeiro. Our methods
   achieved good quality for Kauane Insurance Lower and Kauane Insurance
   Upper, and promising results for Kauane Insurance Report. (C) 2021

Title = {Key Information Extraction for Crime Investigation by Hybrid
   Classification Model},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The 2021 amendment to South Korea's Criminal Procedure Law has
   significantly enhanced the role of the police as investigative
   authorities. Consequently, there is a heightened demand for advanced
   investigative expertise among the police, driven by an increase in the
   number of cases each investigator handles and the extended time required
   for report preparation. This situation underscores the necessity for an
   artificial-intelligence-supported system to augment the efficiency of
   investigators. In response, this study designs a hybrid model that
   fine-tunes two Transformer-based pre-trained language models to
   automatically extract 18 key pieces of information from legal documents.
   To facilitate this, ``The Major Information Frame of Homicide Criminal
   Facts{''} was developed, and a large-scale training dataset specialized
   in the criminal investigation field was constructed. The hybrid
   classification model proposed in this research achieved an F1 score of
   87.75\%, indicating superior performance compared to using a single
   machine reading model. Additionally, the model's top three predicted
   answers included the correct answer at a rate exceeding 98\%,
   demonstrating a high accuracy level. These results suggest that the
   hybrid classification model designed in this study can play a crucial
   role in efficiently extracting essential information from complex legal
   and investigative documents. Based on these findings, it is confirmed
   that the hybrid classification model can be applied not only in drafting
   investigative reports but also in tasks such as searching for similar
   case precedents and constructing case timelines in various legal and
   investigative applications. The advancement is expected to provide a
   standardized approach that allows all investigators to perform objective
   investigations and hypothesis testing, thereby enhancing the fairness
   and efficiency of the investigative process.},

Title = {Using machine learning to create a repository of judgments concerning a

Abstract = {Judgments concerning animals have arisen across a variety of established
   practice areas. There is, however, no publicly available repository of
   judgments concerning the emerging practice area of animal protection
   law. This has hindered the identification of individual animal
   protection law judgments and comprehension of the scale of animal
   protection law made by courts. Thus, we detail the creation of an
   initial animal protection law repository using natural language
   processing and machine learning techniques. This involved domain expert
   classification of 500 judgments according to whether or not they were
   concerned with animal protection law. 400 of these judgments were used
   to train various models, each of which was used to predict the
   classification of the remaining 100 judgments. The predictions of each
   model were superior to a baseline measure intended to mimic current
   searching practice, with the best performing model being a support
   vector machine (SVM) approach that classified judgments according to
   term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) values. Investigation
   of this model consisted of considering its most influential features and
   conducting an error analysis of all incorrectly predicted judgments.
   This showed the features indicative of animal protection law judgments
   to include terms such as `welfare', `hunt' and `cull', and that
   incorrectly predicted judgments were often deemed marginal decisions by
   the domain expert. The TF-IDF SVM was then used to classify non-labelled
   judgments, resulting in an initial animal protection law repository.
   Inspection of this repository suggested that there were 175 animal
   protection judgments between January 2000 and December 2020 from the
   Privy Council, House of Lords, Supreme Court and upper England and Wales
   courts.},

Title = {The GDPR enforcement fines at glance},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {106},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018.
   After this enforcement, many fines have already been imposed by national
   data protection authorities in Europe. This paper examines the
   individual GDPR articles referenced in the enforcement decisions, as
   well as predicts the amount of enforcement fines with available
   meta-data and text mining features extracted from the enforcement
   decision documents. According to the results, three articles related to
   the general principles, lawfulness, and information security have been
   the most frequently referenced ones. Although the amount of fines
   imposed vary across the articles referenced, these three particular
   articles do not stand out. Furthermore, a better statistical evidence is
   available with other meta-data features, including information about the
   particular European countries in which the enforcements were made.
   Accurate predictions are attainable even with simple machine learning
   techniques for regression analysis. Basic text mining features
   outperform the meta-data features in this regard. In addition to these
   results, the paper reflects the GDPR's enforcement against public
   administration obstacles in the European Union (EU), as well as
   discusses the use of automatic decision-making systems in judiciary.

Abstract = {This review paper provides a thorough analysis of transformer-based
   models, specifically ChatGPT and Bard, exploring their many uses,
   underlying difficulties, and potential future developments. Through a
   synthesis of current research findings, it highlights the
   transformational power and possible drawbacks of these models in a
   variety of fields. The study delves deeper into the moral issues,
   societal ramifications, and complex roles these models play in fields
   including environmental research, digital forensics, healthcare, and
   education. The changing field of artificial intelligence is also
   covered, emphasizing the necessity of domain-specific modifications as
   well as the significance of resolving ethical and technological issues
   in the ongoing creation and use of increasingly sophisticated AI
   systems.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence and Inclusion: Formerly Gang-Involved Youth as
   Domain Experts for Analyzing Unstructured Twitter Data},

Abstract = {Mining social media data for studying the human condition has created
   new and unique challenges. When analyzing social media data from
   marginalized communities, algorithms lack the ability to accurately
   interpret off-line context, which may lead to dangerous assumptions
   about and implications for marginalized communities. To combat this
   challenge, we hired formerly gang-involved young people as domain
   experts for contextualizing social media data in order to create
   inclusive, community-informed algorithms. Utilizing data from the Gang
   Intervention and Computer Science Project-a comprehensive analysis of
   Twitter data from gang-involved youth in Chicago-we describe the process
   of involving formerly gang-involved young people in developing a new
   part-of-speech tagger and content classifier for a prototype natural
   language processing system that detects aggression and loss in Twitter
   data. We argue that involving young people as domain experts leads to
   more robust understandings of context, including localized language,
   culture, and events. These insights could change how data scientists
   approach the development of corpora and algorithms that affect people in
   marginalized communities and who to involve in that process. We offer a
   contextually driven interdisciplinary approach between social work and
   data science that integrates domain insights into the training of
   qualitative annotators and the production of algorithms for positive
   social impact.},

Abstract = {The revolution in hardware technology has made it possible to obtain
   high-definition data through highly sophisticated algorithms. Deep
   learning has emerged and is widely used in various fields, and the
   judicial area is no exception. As the carrier of the litigation
   activities, the judgment documents record the process and results of the
   people's courts, and their quality directly affects the fairness and
   credibility of the law. To be able to measure the quality of judgment
   documents, the interpretability of judgment documents has been an
   indispensable dimension. Unfortunately, due to the various
   uncontrollable factors during the process, such as data transmission and
   storage, The data set for training usually has a poor quality. Besides,
   due to the severe imbalance of the distribution of case data, data
   augmentation is essential to generate data for low-frequency cases.
   Based on the existing data set and the application scenarios, we explore
   data quality issues in four areas. Then we systematically investigate
   them to figure out their impact on the data set. After that, we compare
   the four dimensions to find out which one has the most considerable
   damage to the data set.},

Abstract = {This article presents a case study of a money-laundering process. A
   database of police interrogations for a number of interrelated cases
   shows the enormous complexity of this process, exceeding the capacities
   of manual reconstruction. For this reason, semantic networks were
   reconstructed from the textual data, using the natural language
   processing techniques of artificial intelligence. These enabled the
   semantic field of this particular case to be dissected. The results
   reveal highly professional worldwide financial transactions. Criminal
   activity benefited from the infrastructure of offshore centres of the
   legal financial economy and permeated legal business, and the borders
   between legal and illegal activities became blurred. In fact, the
   money-laundering activity was only uncovered after the network broke
   down. Before the group had become known following an outbreak of
   internal conflict, the concealment of illegal sources of money had not
   been detected by law enforcement agencies. A case study does not allow
   for generalization. In particular, this case is not representative
   because the actors had access to significant resources beyond the reach
   of petty criminals. However, the findings from this case suggest that,
   in principle, professional money launderers are able to evade
   money-laundering regulations.},

Abstract = {Legal judgment (e.g., charge, law article and prison term) prediction is
   an important task for Legal AI, aiming to assist the judges to get the
   legal judgment and improve the efficiency of judges. Recently, many
   existing works have been proposed to promote the performance of legal
   judgment prediction. While most of them pay attention to confusing
   charges identification and article recommendation, neglecting the prison
   term prediction could limit the overall performance (e.g., the accuracy
   of prison term is less than 50\%). In this paper, we focus on the task
   of prison term prediction. According to the principle of ``treating like
   cases alike{''} stressed by the Supreme People's Court of China, we
   propose a similar case based prison term prediction (SPTP) method,
   consisting of a prison term prediction module and a prison term
   rectification module. The prison term prediction module uses the basic
   prison term prediction method to get an initial prison term, and then
   the prison term rectification module rectifies the initial prison term
   to acquire the final prison term prediction. Specifically, the
   rectification module includes a similar case retrieval part and a
   sentencing rectification part. Extensive experiments show the
   effectiveness of our method under the quantitative evaluation metrics.},

Title = {Investigation of bias in the automated assessment of school violence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {157},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives: Natural language processing and machine learning have the
   potential to lead to biased predictions. We designed a novel Automated
   RIsk Assessment (ARIA) machine learning algorithm that assesses risk of
   violence and aggression in adolescents using natural language processing
   of transcribed student interviews. This work evaluated the possible
   sources of bias in the study design and the algorithm, tested how much
   of a prediction was explained by demographic covariates, and
   investigated the misclassifications based on demographic variables.
   Methods: We recruited students 10-18 years of age and enrolled in middle
   or high schools in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee. The reference
   standard outcome was determined by a forensic psychiatrist as either a
   ``high{''} or ``low{''} risk level. ARIA used L2-regularized logistic
   regression to predict a risk level for each student using contextual and
   semantic features. We conducted three analyses: a PROBAST analysis of
   risk in study design; analysis of demographic variables as covariates;
   and a prediction analysis. Covariates were included in the linear
   regression analyses and comprised of race, sex, ethnicity, household
   education, annual household income, age at the time of visit, and
   utilization of public assistance. Results: We recruited 412 students
   from 204 schools. ARIA performed with an AUC of 0.92, sensitivity of
   71\%, NPV of 77\%, and specificity of 95\%. Of these, 387 students with
   complete demographic information were included in the analysis.
   Individual linear regressions resulted in a coefficient of determination
   less than 0.08 across all demographic variables. When using all
   demographic variables to predict ARIA's risk assessment score, the
   multiple linear regression model resulted in a coefficient of
   determination of 0.189. ARIA performed with a lower False Negative Rate
   (FNR) of 15.2\% (CI {[}0 - 40]) for the Black subgroup and 12.7\%, CI
   {[}0 - 41.4] for Other races, compared to an FNR of 26.1\% (CI {[}14.1 -
   41.8]) in the White subgroup. Conclusions: Bias assessment is needed to
   address shortcomings within machine learning. In our work, student race,
   ethnicity, sex, use of public assistance, and annual household income
   did not explain ARIA's risk assessment score of students. ARIA will
   continue to be evaluated regularly with increased subject recruitment.},

Abstract = {Court's view generation is a novel but essential task for legal AI,
   aiming at improving the interpretability of judgment prediction results
   and enabling automatic legal document generation. While prior
   text-to-text natural language generation (NLG) approaches can be used to
   address this problem, neglecting the confounding bias from the data
   generation mechanism can limit the model performance, and the bias may
   pollute the learning outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel
   Attentional and Counterfactual based Natural Language Generation
   (AC-NLG) method, consisting of an attentional encoder and a pair of
   innovative counterfactual decoders. The attentional encoder leverages
   the plaintiff's claim and fact description as input to learn a
   claim-aware encoder from which the claim-related information in fact
   description can be emphasized. The counterfactual decoders are employed
   to eliminate the confounding bias in data and generate
   judgment-discriminative court's views (both supportive and
   non-supportive views) by incorporating with a synergistic judgment
   predictive model. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of
   our method under both quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics.},

Abstract = {France is rolling out an open data program for all court cases, but with
   few metadata attached. Reusers will have to use named-entity recognition
   (NER) within the text body of the case to extract any value from it. Any
   court case may include up to 26 variables, or labels, that are related
   to the proceeding, regardless of the case substance. These labels are
   from different syntactic types: some of them are rare; others are
   ubiquitous. This experiment compares different algorithms, namely CRF,
   SpaCy, Flair and DeLFT, to extract proceedings data and uses the
   learning model assessment capabilities of Kairntech, an NLP platform. It
   shows that an NER model can apply to this large and diverse set of
   labels and extract data of high quality. We achieved an 87.5\% F1
   measure with Flair trained on more than 27,000 manual annotations.
   Quality may yet be improved by combining NER models by data type.},

Abstract = {The growing popularity of social media raises concerns about children's
   online safety. Of particular concern are interactions between minors and
   adults with predatory intentions. Unfortunately, previous research on
   online sexual grooming has relied on time-intensive manual annotation by
   domain experts, limiting both the scale and scope of possible
   interventions. This work explores the possibility of detecting predatory
   behaviours with accuracy comparable to expert annotators using machine
   learning (ML). Using a dataset of 6771 chat messages sent by child sex
   offenders, labelled by two of the authors who are forensic psychology
   experts, we study how well can deep learning algorithms identify eleven
   known predatory behaviours. We find that the best-performing ML models
   are consistent but not on par with expert annotation. We therefore
   consider a system where an expert annotator validates the ML algorithms
   outputs. The combination of human decision-making and computer
   efficiency yields precision-but not recall-comparable to manual
   annotation, while taking only a fraction of the time needed by a human
   annotator. Our findings underscore the promise of ML as a tool for
   assisting researchers in this area, but also highlight the current
   limitations in reliably detecting online sexual exploitation using ML.},

Abstract = {Data mining is a way to extract knowledge out of usually large data
   sets; in other words it is an approach to discover hidden relationships
   among data by using artificial intelligence methods. The wide range of
   data mining applications has made it an important field of research.
   Criminology is one of the most important fields for applying data
   mining. Criminology is a process that aims to identify crime
   characteristics. Actually crime analysis includes exploring and
   detecting crimes and their relationships with criminals. The high volume
   of crime datasets and also the complexity of relationships between these
   kinds of data have made criminology an appropriate field for applying
   data mining techniques. Identifying crime characteristics is the first
   step for developing further analysis. The knowledge that is gained from
   data mining approaches is a very useful tool which can help and support
   police forces. An approach based on data mining techniques is discussed
   in this paper to extract important entities from police narrative
   reports which are written in plain text. By using this approach, crime
   data can be automatically entered into a database, in law enforcement
   agencies. We have also applied a SOM clustering method in the scope of
   crime analysis and finally we will use the clustering results in order
   to perform crime matching process. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Legal documents are considered one of the most difficult types of
   documents to write and interpret due to the fact that they use legal
   jargon and follow a specific legal convention. For a legal practitioner,
   they require documents, mainly judgements, for the proceedings in their
   client's case. We evaluated the approach of Named Entity Recognition on
   a large corpus of legal judgements and found 14 entities, such as case
   number, name of judge, name of court, statute, provision, etc. Through
   this, we found that one cannot comprehend the document completely as it
   is written in a complex manner. We also conduct a complexity analysis of
   the legal documents using a variety of linguistic features, including
   sentence length, word frequency, and syntactic complexity. Considering
   the presence of legal jargon, we defined a method to analyse the
   complexity on these legal documents and a suitable score to understand
   them. Given that there are no specific ways for defining the complexity
   of legal documents, we performed human evaluation and achieved the best
   value for the recommended approaches with the assistance of legal
   experts.},

Title = {Discouraging the Demand That Fosters Sex Trafficking: Collaboration
   through Augmented Intelligence},
Journal = {SOCIETIES},
Year = {2023},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Augmented intelligence-as the fusion of human and artificial
   intelligence-is effectively being employed in response to a spectrum of
   risks and crimes that stem from the online sexual exploitation
   marketplace. As part of a study that was sponsored by the National
   Institute of Justice, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation has
   documented 15 tactics that have been used in more than 2650 US cities
   and counties to deter sex buyers from engaging with prostitution and sex
   trafficking systems. One of these tactics, technology-based enforcement
   and deterrence methods, has been used in more than 78 locations in the
   United States. This paper explores the issue of technology-facilitated
   trafficking in the online sexual exploitation marketplace and juxtaposes
   this with the use of augmented intelligence in collaborative responses
   to these crimes. Illustrative case studies are presented that describe
   how two organizations employ technology that utilizes the complementary
   strengths of humans and machines to deter sex buyers at the point of
   purchase. The human(e) touch of these organizations, combined with
   artificial intelligence, natural language processing, constructed
   websites, photos, and mobile technology, show significant potential for
   operational scaling, and provide a template for consideration by law
   enforcement agencies, criminal justice systems, and the larger
   multidisciplinary counter-trafficking community for collaborative
   replication in other settings.},

Title = {Using machine learning to assess rape reports: Sentiment analysis
   detection of officers' ``signaling{''} about victims' credibility},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE},

Abstract = {Purpose: The first of two articles from a larger study whose aim was to
   teach a computer to detect innuendo (or signaling) about a victim's
   credibility in incident reports of rape. This study explored the degree
   of sentiment and subjectivity in the reports and whether these predicted
   case progression and outcomes.Methods: We employed machine learning,
   specifically sentiment analysis to assess sentiment (opinion) and
   subjectivity of textual content. The sample consists of 5638 incident
   reports of rape with a sexual assault kit from a U.S., urban Midwestern
   jurisdiction.Results: Sentiment was detected, tended to skew near
   neutral/slightly negative and more subjective, and predicted case
   progression and outcomes, but was not quite what was
   expected.Conclusions: We taught a computer to detect signaling via tone
   that predicted case progression and outcomes. Findings indicate that the
   cases recommended for prosecution were longer and had positive sentiment
   and positive subjectivity. Cases not recommended for prosecution were
   shorter with more neutral statements of ``fact{''} or observations.
   Implications and recommendations for improved, less biased report
   writing are provided.},

Abstract = {Cyber threat attribution identifies the source of a malicious cyber
   activity, which in turn informs cyber security mitigation responses and
   strategies. Such responses and strategies are crucial for deterring
   future attacks, particularly in the financial and critical
   infrastructure sectors. However, existing approaches generally rely on
   manual analysis of attack indicators obtained through approaches such as
   trace-back, firewalls, intrusion detection and honeypot deployments.
   These attack indicators, also known as low-level Indicators of
   Compromise (IOCs), are rarely re-used and can be easily modified and
   disguised resulting in a deceptive and biased cyber threat attribution.
   Cyber attackers, particularly financially-motivated actors, can use
   common high-level attack patterns that evolve less frequently as
   compared to the low-level IOCs. To attribute cyber threats effectively,
   it is necessary to identify them based on the high-level adversary's
   attack patterns (e.g. tactics, techniques and procedures - TTPs,
   software tools and malware) employed in different phases of the cyber
   kill chain. Identification of high-level attack patterns is
   time-consuming, requiring forensic investigation of the victim
   network(s) and other resources. In the rare case that attack patterns
   are reported in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, the format is
   textual and unstructured typically taking the form of lengthy incident
   reports prepared for human consumption (e.g. prepared for C-level and
   senior management executives), which cannot be directly interpreted by
   machines. Thus, in this paper we propose a framework to automate cyber
   threat attribution. Specifically, we profile cyber threat actors (CTAs)
   based on their attack patterns extracted from CTI reports, using the
   distributional semantics technique of Natural Language Processing. Using
   these profiles, we train and test five machine learning classifiers on
   327 CTI reports collected from publicly available incident reports that
   cover events from May 2012 to February 2018. It is observed that the CTA
   profiles obtained attribute cyber threats with a high precision (i.e.
   83\% as compared to other publicly available CTA profiles, where the
   precision is 33\%). The Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) based
   classifier also attributes cyber threats with a higher accuracy (i.e.
   94\% as compared to other classifiers). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The Large Language Models (LLMs) have impacted many real-life tasks. To
   examine the efficacy of LLMs in a high-stake domain like law, we have
   applied state-of-the-art LLMs for two popular tasks: Statute Prediction
   and Judgment Prediction, on Indian Supreme Court cases. We see that
   while LLMs exhibit excellent predictive performance in Statute
   Prediction, their performance dips in Judgment Prediction when compared
   with many standard models. The explanations generated by LLMs (along
   with prediction) are of moderate to decent quality. We also see evidence
   of gender and religious bias in the LLM-predicted results. In addition,
   we present a note from a senior legal expert on the ethical concerns of
   deploying LLMs in these critical legal tasks.},

Abstract = {Many researchers have contributed to the field of authorship profiling
   and offered a variety of Artificial Intelligence methods, including
   machine and deep learning. The advent and application of
   transformer-based pre-trained models such as BERT and other successive
   models enabled researchers to improve the accuracy of applied models in
   different natural language processing domains. A crucial domain that
   attracted our attention is authorship profiling, wherein anonymous
   authors' demographic information (e.g., age and gender) is determined.
   In this paper, we present a comparative study wherein we examine which
   of the selected pretrained models perform the best when determining
   authors' ages and genders; we employ the BERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet
   pre-trained models and experiment with different hyperparameter values
   to observe the effect of each associated variable. We find that the
   selection of certain hyperparameters allow the models to successfully
   converge; we conclude that with specific hyperparameter values, the BERT
   model yielded the highest result for the age- and gender-profiling
   tasks.},

Title = {An interpretable approach to detect case law on housing and eviction
   issues within the HUDOC database},
Journal = {ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 12},
Abstract = {Case law plays a critical role in shaping our understanding of human
   rights, including the right to adequate housing. However, analyzing
   large legal databases like HUDOC, which contains over 40,000 cases, is a
   challenging task that requires automated solutions. This study focuses
   on detecting cases related to housing-a topic encompassing issues such
   as eviction, access to adequate housing and etc.-from the HUDOC
   database. For this, we developed classifiers to identify cases related
   to both housing and eviction issues. We first constructed a dataset
   using an unsupervised process refined through manual corrections. Then,
   we trained the Adaptive Chordal Distance-based Subspace Learning Vector
   Quantization models. These models achieved classification accuracies of
   93\% for housing-related cases and 91.5\% for eviction-specific cases,
   matching the performance of transformer-based models while requiring
   fewer computational resources. Furthermore, they provide
   interpretability by assigning word-level importance scores, helping
   legal scholars understand and verify the reasoning behind the model's
   predictions. The models identified 2,305 potentially housing-related
   cases. Manual reviews confirmed that 278 of 340 reviewed cases were
   indeed relevant. By detecting overlooked cases and enriching legal
   datasets, this study highlights the utility of NLP methods in
   facilitating the analysis of human rights case law. This approach
   supports a deeper exploration of housing rights and eviction-related
   decisions under the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), offering
   transparency, efficiency, and scalability for legal research.},

Abstract = {Microsoft's PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language
   that is installed by default on Windows machines. Based on
   Microsoft's.NET framework, it includes an interface that allows
   programmers to access operating system services. While PowerShell can be
   configured by administrators for restricting access and reducing
   vulnerabilities, these restrictions can be bypassed. Moreover,
   PowerShell commands can be easily generated dynamically, executed from
   memory, encoded and obfuscated, thus making the logging and forensic
   analysis of code executed by PowerShell challenging.
   For all these reasons, PowerShell is increasingly used by cybercriminals
   as part of their attacks' tool chain, mainly for downloading malicious
   contents and for lateral movement. Indeed, a recent comprehensive
   technical report by Symantec dedicated to PowerShell's abuse by
   cybercrimials {[}52] reported on a sharp increase in the number of
   malicious PowerShell samples they received and in the number of
   penetration tools and frameworks that use PowerShell. This highlights
   the urgent need of developing effective methods for detecting malicious
   PowerShell commands.
   In this work, we address this challenge by implementing several novel
   detectors of malicious PowerShell commands and evaluating their
   performance. We implemented both ``traditional{''} natural language
   processing (NLP) based detectors and detectors based on character-level
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Detectors' performance was
   evaluated using a large real-world dataset.
   Our evaluation results show that, although our detectors (and especially
   the traditional NLP-based ones) individually yield high performance, an
   ensemble detector that combines an NLP-based classifier with a CNN
   -based classifier provides the best performance, since the latter
   classifier is able to detect malicious commands that succeed in evading
   the former. Our analysis of these evasive commands reveals that some
   obfuscation patterns automatically detected by the CNN classifier are
   intrinsically difficult to detect using the NLP techniques we applied.
   Our detectors provide high recall values while maintaining a very low
   false positive rate, making us cautiously optimistic that they can be of
   practical value.},

Abstract = {This study emphasizes the pivotal role of advanced computational
   methods, particularly natural language processing (NLP), in offense
   analysis and IPC section classification within the realm of criminal
   justice. It underscores the importance of identifying IPC section
   applicability in First Information Reports (FIRs), detailing the process
   of achieving optimal results through comparisons between Jaccard
   similarity, word embedding techniques, and the offense feature
   extraction (OFE) method. A dataset comprising 100 FIRs was collected,
   with manual analysis conducted to select offense terms as feature
   selections and determine their applicable Indian Penal Code (IPC)
   sections. Subsequently, a model was trained using these offense terms to
   predict the applicable IPC sections, and tested on a set of 35 new FIRs
   to assess accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of
   leveraging advanced computational methods for offense analysis and
   classification, with implications for enhancing the efficiency and
   accuracy of legal proceedings. The average accuracy achieved by Jaccard
   similarity is impressively high. Moreover, when utilized in the mode
   Jaccard form, count vectorization consistently displays a tendency to
   attain superior accuracy across most FIRs. This indicates that Jaccard
   similarity, particularly when combined with count vectorization,
   showcases robust performance in effectively categorizing FIRs. Upon
   examining the offense feature extraction (OFE) method, the incidence of
   false negatives (FN) is found to be minimal. Future scope involves
   transitioning from individual word selection to group-based feature
   selection for improved accuracy and clarity, as well as automating and
   optimizing FIR interpretation and legal statute determination to enhance
   the efficiency, accuracy, and fairness of legal procedures.},

Abstract = {As a growing number of policies are adopted to address the substantial
   rise in urbanization, there is a significant push for smart governance,
   endowing transparency in decision-making and enabling greater public
   involvement. The thriving concept of smart governance goes beyond just
   cities, ultimately aiming at a smart planet. Ordinances (local laws)
   affect our life with regard to health, business, etc. This is
   particularly notable during major events such as the recent pandemic,
   which may lead to rapid changes in ordinances, pertaining for instance
   to public safety, disaster management, and recovery phases. However,
   many citizens view ordinances as impervious and complex. This position
   paper proposes a research agenda enabling novel forms of ordinance
   content analysis over time and temporal web question answering (QA) for
   both legislators and the broader public. Along with this, we aim to
   analyze social media posts so as to track the public opinion before and
   after the introduction of ordinances. Challenges include addressing
   concepts changing over time and infusing subtle human reasoning in
   mining, which we aim to address by harnessing terminology evolution
   methods and commonsense knowledge sources, respectively. We aim to make
   the results of the historical ordinance mining and event-driven analysis
   seamlessly accessible, relying on a robust semantic understanding
   framework to flexibly support web QA.},

   such a comparison, using a newly created dataset of all Internal Revenue
   Service (IRS) publications ever released, along with an existing dataset
   of court decisions. It applies natural language processing, machine
   learning, and regression analysis to map methodological trends and to
   test whether particular authorities have developed unique cultures of
   statutory interpretation.
   It finds that, over time, the IRS has increasingly made rules on
   normative policy grounds (like fairness and efficiency) rather than
   merely producing rules based on the ``best reading{''} of the relevant
   statute (under any interpretive theory, like purposivism or textualism).
   Moreover, when the IRS does focus on the statute, it has grown much more
   purposivist over time. In contrast, the Tax Court has not grown more
   normative and has followed the same trend toward textualism as most
   other courts. But although the Tax Court has become more broadly
   textualist, it prioritizes different interpretive tools than other
   courts, like Chevron deference and holistic-textual canons of
   interpretation. This suggests that each authority adopts its own flavor
   of textualism or purposivism.
   These findings complicate the literature on tax exceptionalism and the
   judicial nature of the Tax Court. They also inform ongoing debates about
   judicial deference and the future of doctrines like Chevron and Skidmore
   deference. Most broadly, they provide an empirical counterpoint to the
   existing theoretical literature on statutory interpretation by agencies.},

Abstract = {In legal decisions, split votes (SV) occur when judges cannot reach a
   unanimous decision, posing a difficulty for lawyers who must navigate
   diverse legal arguments and opinions. In high-stakes domains,
   understanding the alignment of perceived difficulty between humans and
   AI systems is crucial to build trust. However, existing NLP calibration
   methods focus on a classifier's awareness of predictive performance,
   measured against the human majority class, overlooking inherent human
   label variation (HLV). This paper explores split votes as naturally
   observable human disagreement and value pluralism. We collect judges'
   vote distributions from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and
   present SV-ECHR1 a case outcome classification (COC) dataset with SV
   information. We build a taxonomy of disagreement with SV-specific
   subcategories. We further assess the alignment of perceived difficulty
   between models and humans, as well as confidence- and human-calibration
   of COC models. We observe limited alignment with the judge vote
   distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic exploration
   of calibration to human judgements in legal NLP. Our study underscores
   the necessity for further research on measuring and enhancing model
   calibration considering HLV in legal decision tasks.},

Abstract = {The global construction industry faces significant risks due to
   disputes. This study aims to predict outcomes in construction dispute
   judicial decisions by analyzing the linguistic interaction between
   plaintiff claims and defendant defenses in Turkish, addressing a
   methodological gap in the literature. The research examines 2,563 Court
   of Cassation decisions in T \& uuml;rkiye from 2011-2021 (from 15,667
   cases), organized into three datasets: containing both plaintiff claims
   and defendant defenses (Dataset I), only plaintiff claims (Dataset II),
   and all decisions (Dataset III). Dataset I uniquely captures the impact
   of defendant voice, demonstrating how including counterarguments
   significantly enhances model performance. Standard preprocessing
   techniques were applied to address Turkish morphological challenges.
   Among various feature extraction methods, TF-IDF demonstrated superior
   performance. The HistGradientBoosting achieved optimal performance, with
   Dataset I reaching 87.38\% accuracy compared to 84.53\% for Dataset II,
   proving that modeling mutual arguments enhances prediction beyond using
   plaintiff claims alone, exceeding success rates in comparable
   literature. This study pioneers a framework for analyzing the dialectics
   of legal texts in construction disputes, with applications across
   different legal systems.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a method called SUmmarisation with Majority
   Opinion (SUMO) that integrates and extends two prior approaches for
   abstractively and extractively summarising UK House of Lords cases. We
   show how combining two previously distinct lines of work allows us to
   better address the challenges resulting from this court's unusual
   tradition of publishing the opinions of multiple judges with no formal
   statement of the reasoning (if any) agreed by a majority. We do this by
   applying natural language processing and machine learning, Conditional
   Random Fields (CRFs), to a data set we created by fusing together
   expert-annotated sentence labels from the HOLJ corpus of rhetorical role
   summary relevance with the ASMO corpus of agreement statement and
   majority opinion. By using CRFs and a bespoke summary generator on our
   enriched data set, we show a significant quantitative F1-score
   improvement in rhetorical role and relevance classification of 10-15\%
   over the state-of-the-art SUM system; and we show a significant
   qualitative improvement in the quality of our summaries, which closely
   resemble goldstandard multi-judge abstracts according to a
   proof-of-principle user study.},

Title = {Feasibility of using an artificially intelligent chatbot to increase
   access to information and sexual and reproductive health services},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Background Following the US Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v.
   Wade, there is evidence of limitations in access to safe abortion care.
   Artificially intelligent (AI)-enabled conversational chatbots are
   becoming an appealing option to support access to care, but generative
   AI systems can misinform and hallucinate and risk reinforcing
   problematic bias and stigma related to sexual and reproductive
   healthcare.Method A single arm pilot study describing the development of
   an AI chatbot focused on sexual and reproductive health and its
   deployment in a clinic setting and community-based organization over a
   nine-month period.Results We adjusted chatbot content based on feedback
   from the medical director and clients of organizations where the system
   was deployed given updated medical guidelines and preferred language
   related to gender-affirming care. We deployed the system in two
   organizations and tracked use over nine months. In that time, there were
   1749 queries from 425 unique users. One-tenth of users of the clinic
   based chatbot went on to schedule an appointment for care.Conclusions
   Ongoing challenges in accessing sexual and reproductive health suggest
   having diverse mechanisms to facilitate access to accurate and updated
   medical information is warranted. Using an AI chatbot is feasible to
   accomplish this goal and shows promise in increasing opportunities to
   access care.},

Abstract = {Criminal investigators, faced with the complexity of knowledge discovery
   in major cases, can benefit from integrating information retrieval and
   natural language processing in their workflow. We explore the
   application of pre-trained sentence embeddings for clustering and
   semantic search, presenting promising results. Evaluating over 3,700
   Norwegian police reports from high-profile cases; we find that sentence
   embeddings enhance information retrieval speed and reveal previously
   unnoticed data, offering valuable insights for future applications in
   the field of criminal investigations.},

Abstract = {Scholars still have a mixed picture of the impact of online public
   involvement in regulatory policy making, and a shortage of theoretical
   explanations. The novel theory put forward in this article is that
   substantive, technical and political factors combined can help explain
   the degree of success public involvement will have in shaping proposed
   rules. Using a study with 25 regulations from the United States
   Department of Education, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) measures the
   degree of content change between proposed rules and final rules.
   Substantive and political aspects in democratic legitimacy and pluralism
   approaches to participation, anteced-ents are theorized, and
   associations of the antecedents with the degree of content change are
   assessed using Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Findings show
   that the substantive public contributions do make a difference
   especially when media attention and input from professional
   organizations is present.},

Abstract = {This paper draws on machine learning methods for text classification to
   predict the ideological direction of decisions from the associated text.
   Using a 5\% hand-coded sample of cases from U.S. Circuit Courts, we
   explore and evaluate a variety of machine classifiers to predict
   ``conservative decision{''} or ``liberal decision{''} in held-out data.
   Our best classifier is highly predictive (F1 = .65) and allows us to
   extrapolate ideological direction to the full sample. We then use these
   predictions to replicate and extend Landes and Posner's (2009) analysis
   of how the party of the nominating president influences circuit judge's
   votes. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM LEGAL DATABASES INTRODUCTION},
Booktitle = {KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM LEGAL DATABASES},
Series = {Law and Philosophy Library},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {1-13},
Abstract = {Data is now collected in a variety of commercial and scientific fields
   in such quantities that the problem of automating the elicitation of
   meaningful knowledge from data has become pressing. For example, data
   sets from astronomical observations were once manually scanned by
   experts searching for anomalies or interesting patterns. However, as
   {[}Fayyad et al 1996] note, the manual analysis of data in astronomy is
   no longer feasible since data sets in this field often exceed many
   thousands of millions of records.
   In the legal domain information is often stored as text in relatively
   unstructured forms. Primary statutes, judgments in past cases and
   commentaries are typically stored as text based documents. In contrast,
   scientific and commercial information is collected in a more structured
   manner. Grocery items at most supermarkets are bar-coded and scanned at
   purchase. Computer systems link retailers with suppliers and suppliers
   with distribution centres in order to streamline the provision of goods.
   The data collected about each item is used to closely monitor sales and
   the performance of processes within those organisations.
   In contrast, many applications for Court hearings are paper based,
   though the use of case management systems is becoming increasingly
   common. Judgments record relevant findings of fact and rulings in the
   form of a narrative but fact values are rarely stored in a structured
   format such as a database. This has consequences for the future
   retrieval of similar cases, for the management of Courts, and for the
   analysis and prediction of legal decisions using knowledge discovery
   from database techniques.
   If judgments are stored as a narrative, the retrieval of a past case
   involves scanning the text of past cases. Commercial search engines such
   as Lexis and Westlaw search for multiple keywords using Boolean AND, OR
   and NOT operators. Nevertheless, retrieving all the cases that are
   relevant to a query and none that are irrelevant is very difficult.
   {[}Rose 1993] identifies the limitations of keyword search and describes
   a technique for converting the narrative judgment into a semi-structured
   representation which has been derived from artificial intelligence.
   Retrieval performance is significantly enhanced by this approach.
   The focus of this text is in on the potential that knowledge discovery
   from database techniques have to improve the prediction and analysis of
   case outcomes. According to {[}Frawley et al 1991] knowledge discovery
   from databases (KDD) is the `non trivial extraction of implicit,
   previously unknown and potentially useful information from data'. Data
   mining is a problem-solving methodology that finds a logical or
   mathematical description, eventually of a complex nature, of patterns
   and regularities in a set of data {[}Fayyad et al 1996].
   The Victorian ( Australia) Parliamentary Committee on Law Reform {[}
   Parliament of Victoria 1999] identified many ways in which technology
   can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal profession and
   judiciary. Many of their recommendations involve the storage of data in
   a more structured form.
   Law has not yet been characterised with data collected in structured
   formats in the quantities apparent in other fields. However, knowledge
   discovery techniques have begun to be applied to legal domains in useful
   ways. Existing attempts in this direction provide important insights
   into the benefits for the practice of law in the future and also
   illustrate problems for KDD unique to the legal domain.
   According to {[}Fayyad et al 1996] KDD techniques, in general can be
   grouped into four categories:
   a) Classification. The aim of classification techniques is to group data
   into predefined categories. For example, data representing important
   case facts from many cases may be used to classify a new case into one
   of the pre-defined categories, `pro-plaintiff' or `pro-defendant'.
   b) Clustering. The aim of clustering techniques is to analyse the data
   in order to group the data into groups of similar data. For example, a
   clustering technique may group cases into six main clusters that an
   analyst would interpret in order to learn something about the cases.
   c) Series Analysis. The aim of series analysis is to discover sequences
   within the data. Sequences typically sought are time series. For
   example, past cases over a time period may be analysed in order to
   discover important changes in the way a core concept is interpreted by
   Courts.
   d) Association. The objective of association techniques is to discover
   ways in which data elements are associated with other data elements. For
   example, an association between the gender of litigants and the outcome
   of their cases may surprise analysts and stimulate hypotheses to explain
   the phenomena.
   e) Text mining. This refers to information retrieval methods, the
   automated generation of a document summary, the extraction of concepts
   such as case factors from judgements, the assignment of a document to a
   category and other approaches that deal with large repositories of
   textual documents.
   Although KDD with data from legal databases is not prevalent, important
   examples of classification, clustering, series analysis, association and
   time series have been performed. These examples are presented in the
   next section.},

Journal = {HELIYON},

Abstract = {The Darkweb, part of the deep web, can be accessed only through
   specialized computer software and used for illegal activities such as
   cybercrime, drug trafficking, and exploitation. Technological
   advancements like Tor, bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies allow criminals to
   carry out these activities anonymously, leading to increased use of the
   Darkweb. At the same time, computers have become an integral part of our
   daily lives, shaping our behavior, and influencing how we interact with
   each other and the world. This work carries out the bibliometric study
   on the research conducted on Darkweb over the last decade. The findings
   illustrate that most research on Darkweb can be clustered into four
   areas based on keyword co-occurrence analysis: (i) network security,
   malware, and cyber-attacks, (ii) cybercrime, data privacy, and
   cryptography, (iii) machine learning, social media, and artificial
   intelligence, and (iv) drug trafficking, cryptomarket. National Science
   Foundation from the United States is the top funder. Darkweb activities
   interfere with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) laid forth by the
   United Nations to promote peace and sustainability for current and
   future generations. SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) has
   the highest number of publications and citations but has an inverse
   relationship with Darkweb, as the latter undermines the former. This
   study highlights the need for further research in bitcoin, blockchain,
   IoT, NLP, cryptocurrencies, phishing and cybercrime, botnets and
   malware, digital forensics, and electronic crime countermeasures about
   the Darkweb. The study further elucidates the multi-dimensional nature
   of the Darkweb, emphasizing the intricate relationship between
   technology, psychology, and geopolitics. This comprehensive
   understanding serves as a cornerstone for evolving effective
   countermeasures and calls for an interdisciplinary research approach.
   The study also delves into the psychological motivations driving
   individuals towards illegal activities on the Darkweb, highlighting the
   urgency for targeted interventions to promote pro-social online
   behavior.},

Title = {Automatic detection of potentially illegal online sales of elephant
   ivory via data mining},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this work, we developed an automated system to detect potentially
   illegal elephant ivory items for sale on eBay. Two law enforcement
   experts, with specific knowledge of elephant ivory identification,
   manually classified items on sale in the Antiques section of eBay UK
   over an 8 week period. This set the ``Gold Standard{''} that we aim to
   emulate using data-mining. We achieved close to 93\% accuracy with less
   data than the experts, as we relied entirely on metadata, but did not
   employ item descriptions or associated images, thus proving the
   potential and generality of our approach. The reported accuracy may be
   improved with the addition of text mining techniques for the analysis of
   the item description, and by applying image classification for the
   detection of Schreger lines, indicative of elephant ivory. However, any
   solution relying on images or text description could not be employed on
   other wildlife illegal markets where pictures can be missing or
   misleading and text absent (e.g., Instagram). In our setting, we gave
   human experts all available information while only using minimal
   information for our analysis. Despite this, we succeeded at achieving a
   very high accuracy. This work is an important first step in speeding up
   the laborious, tedious and expensive task of expert discovery of illegal
   trade over the internet. It will also allow for faster reporting to law
   enforcement and better accountability. We hope this will also contribute
   to reducing poaching, by making this illegal trade harder and riskier
   for those involved.},

Title = {Identifying Rare Circumstances Preceding Female Firearm Suicides:
   Validating A Large Language Model Approach},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Background: Firearm suicide has been more prevalent among males, but
   age-adjusted female firearm suicide rates increased by 20\% from 2010 to
   2020, outpacing the rate increase among males by about 8 percentage
   points, and female firearm suicide may have different contributing
   circumstances. In the United States, the National Violent Death
   Reporting System (NVDRS) is a comprehensive source of data on violent
   deaths and includes unstructured incident narrative reports from
   coroners or medical examiners and law enforcement. Conventional natural
   language processing approaches have been used to identify common
   circumstances preceding female firearm suicide deaths but failed to
   identify rarer circumstances due to insufficient training
   data.Objective: This study aimed to leverage a large language model
   approach to identify infrequent circumstances preceding female firearm
   suicide in the unstructured coroners or medical examiners and law
   enforcement narrative reports available in the NVDRS. Methods: We used
   the narrative reports of 1462 female firearm suicide decedents in the
   NVDRS from 2014 to 2018. The reports were written in English. We coded 9
   infrequent circumstances preceding female firearm suicides. We
   experimented with predicting those circumstances by leveraging a large
   language model approach in a yes/no question-answer format. We measured
   the prediction accuracy with F1-score (ranging from 0 to 1). F1-score is
   the harmonic mean of precision (positive predictive value) and recall
   (true positive rate or sensitivity).Results: Our large language model
   outperformed a conventional support vector machine-supervised machine
   learning approach by a wide margin. Compared to the support vector
   machine model, which had F1-scores less than 0.2 for most infrequent
   circumstances, our large language model approach achieved an F1-score of
   over 0.6 for 4 circumstances and 0.8 for 2 circumstances.Conclusions:
   The use of a large language model approach shows promise. Researchers
   interested in using natural language processing to identify infrequent
   circumstances in narrative report data may benefit from large language
   models.},

Abstract = {In the last few years, social media networks have changed human life
   experience and behavior as it has broken down communication barriers,
   allowing ordinary people to actively produce multimedia content on a
   massive scale. On this wise, the information dissemination in social
   media platforms becomes increasingly common. However, misinformation is
   propagated with the same facility and velocity as real news, though it
   can result in irreversible damage to an individual or society at large.
   Solving this problem is not a trivial task, considering the reduced size
   of the text messages usually posted on these communication vehicles.
   This paper proposes an end-to-end framework called EMET to classify the
   reliability of small messages posted on social media platforms. Our
   method leverages text-embeddings from multilingual-encoder transformers
   that take into consideration the semantic knowledge from preceding
   trustworthy news and the use of the reader's reactions to detect
   misleading content. Our findings demonstrated the value of user
   interaction and prior information to check social media post's
   credibility.},

Title = {The anatomy of deception: Measuring technical and human factors of a
   large-scale phishing campaign},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {140},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In an era dominated by digital interactions, phishing campaigns have
   evolved to exploit not just technological vulnerabilities but also human
   traits. This study takes an unprecedented deep dive into large-scale
   phishing campaigns aimed at Meta's users, offering a dual perspective on
   the technical mechanics and human elements involved. Analysing data from
   over 25,000 victims worldwide, we highlight the nuances of these
   campaigns, from the intricate techniques deployed by the attackers to
   the sentiments and behaviours of those targeted. Unlike prior research
   conducted in controlled environments, this investigation capitalises on
   the vast, diverse, and genuine data extracted directly from active
   phishing campaigns, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the
   drivers, facilitators, and human factors. Through applying advanced
   computational techniques, including natural language processing and
   machine learning, this work unveils critical insights into the psyche of
   victims and the evolving tactics of modern phishers. Our analysis
   illustrates very poor password selection choices from the victims, with
   30.27\% of them picking low-complexity passwords and 58.23\% reusing
   leaked passwords. Additionally, more than 10\% exhibit strong
   persistence in re-victimisation by posting again to the phishing
   platforms of the same phishers. Finally, we reveal many correlations
   regarding demographics and the time periods when victims are more
   vulnerable during the day, as well as analyse the sentiment, emotion,
   and tone of text responses that they submitted, illustrating how
   convinced they were of the scam.},

Abstract = {Given the diverse backgrounds of people living in modern societies as
   well as the international nature of cyber-terrorist threats, profiling
   the type of person behind cyber-mediated crimes has become a norm in
   terrorist profiling practice. This study contributes to timely efficient
   terrorist profiling and threat assessment by showcasing an automated
   content analysis of cyber-mediated terrorist texts, using natural
   language processing technology and AI-assisted analysis. To characterise
   the terrorist type of texts and provide clues to threats, the study
   employs a `psycholinguistic profiling' approach to authorship analysis
   (Grant 2008). That is, it seeks to describe the likelihood of an
   author's engagement in violent extremist activity, identify motives for
   violence, and provide clues vis-a-vis would-be and actual violent
   behaviours. The study takes twenty texts produced by international
   terrorists involved in jihadism and far-right violent extremism as a
   case study. The findings reveal the investigative value of automated
   psycholinguistic profiling for security and intelligence practitioners,
   with the semantic patterns yielding helpful information for an
   understanding of the criminal nature of terrorist language. Also
   revealed is the attentional pattern of extremists and their discourse
   together with clues-based conclusions about text type, as well as
   `warning' behaviours and motives for aggression which vary according to
   the authors' ideological differences.},

Title = {Using motor vehicle crash records for injury surveillance and research

Abstract = {Problem: Fatal injuries in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector
   (AgFF) outweigh those across all sec-tors in the United States.
   Transportation-related injuries are among the top contributors to these
   fatal events. However, traditional occupational injury surveillance
   systems may not completely capture crashes involving farm vehicles and
   logging trucks, specifically nonfatal events.Methods: The study aimed to
   develop an integrated database of AgFF-related motor-vehicle crashes for
   the southwest (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas) and
   to use these data to conduct surveillance and research. Lessons learned
   during the pursuit of these aims were cataloged. Activities centered
   around the conduct of traditional statistical and geospatial analyses of
   structured data fields and natural language processing of free-text
   crash narratives.Results: The structured crash data in each state
   include fields that allowed farm vehicles or equipment and logging
   trucks to be identified. The variable definitions and coding were not
   consistent across states but could be harmonized. All states recorded
   data fields pertaining to person, vehicle, and crash/environmental
   factors. Structured data supported the construction of crash severity
   models and geospatial analyses. Law enforcement provided additional
   details on crash causation in free-text narratives. Crash narratives
   contained sufficient text to support viable machine learning models for
   farm vehicle or equipment crashes, but not for logging truck
   narratives.Discussion: Crash records can help to fill research and
   surveillance gaps in AgFF in the southwest region. This supports traffic
   safety's evolution to the current Safe System paradigm. There is a
   conceptual linkage between the Safe System and Total Worker Health
   approaches, providing a bridge between traffic safety and occupational
   health. Practical Applications: Despite limitations, crash records can
   be an important component of injury surveil-lance for events involving
   AgFF vehicles. They also can be used to inform the selection and
   evaluation of traffic countermeasures and behavioral interventions.},
