	abstract = {Mountain cities are complex asymmetric dynamic network architectures, and the flight of UAVs in this environment is subject to various constraints, while efficiency is a crucial factor in the trajectory planning of police UAVs, which need to maintain high efficiency and safe flight paths between their starting and ending points, but the traditional trajectory planning method cannot meet the requirements of rapid maneuvering of police UAVs. To achieve this, a 3D terrain map is built, an objective function is established for the flight cost in the UAV trajectory planning process, and a planning algorithm called particle swarm optimization bat algorithm (PSOBA) is proposed. PSOBA combines the characteristics of the bat algorithm (BA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to improve population diversity and resolve the delayed convergence issue in the last phases of BA. Simulation results show that PSOBA is more effective than BA, with a search time for the best solution that is approximately 20.43% shorter and a convergence value of the objective function that is approximately 38% smaller. PSOBA is also able to plan a quicker, shorter, and safer flight path compared to other trail planning algorithms that enhance the bat algorithm. These findings suggest that PSOBA is a powerful algorithm with potential application value in UAV trajectory planning control in the mobile intelligence era.Contribute to the service of public social security. © 2024, Science China Press.

	abstract = {In recent years, smart cities have been transforming the way people interact with services thanks to the technological advances in wireless networks, cloud computing and sensors. In this contextm Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are considered as one of the novel technologies that will revolutionize smart cities even further in the coming years. In fact, its use has been continuously growing to reach a wide variety of civilian, commercial, and military applications. In particular, 5G UASs have been gaining popularity within industry major players including retailers and cellular providers thanks to the numerous advantages 5G brings to UAS operations. Despite these attractive features, there are some considerable setbacks that are holding further development in this field. First, there is no global consensus on a unified communication protocol that the growing number of UASs should use. Second, there is a lack of adequate regulations that would help streamline the operations and safety of UASs. Third, there is lack of mechanisms to detect and thwart cyber-attacks targeting UASs. In this paper, we propose UASChainSec, a framework that enables UASs to exchange information in a secure way by leveraging blockchains and 5G communication. UASChainSec abstracts away the burden to define a new protocol for UAS communication by using blockchains. It also solves the cryptographic key distribution in the presence of growing number of drones. Finally, it has the potential to thwart common cyber attacks threatening the operations of UASs. We support our findings by describing the details of the blockchain-based approach and by evaluating the potential of using blockchains to secure UAS communication.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In an area of increasing digitalisation and rapid technological development, information management is becoming essential for the effective functioning of modern organisations and cities. One of the new trends is the gradual expansion and use of drones in parts of the smart cities concept. In security, drones are used to protect public order, monitor traffic in cities and municipalities, and control sub-activities falling under the competence of police forces. In rescue work, drones allow us to efficiently and quickly manage accidental emergencies in hard-to-reach areas. At the same time, in the transport sector, drones have become an important component for the efficient delivery of parcels, reducing overall costs and time savings. This paper systematically overviews the importance of drones in various fields such as security, transportation, rescue operations or parcel delivery. Drones are becoming key elements for public order, crisis management and enhancing the quality of life of citizens in smart cities due to their capabilities of rapid response, monitoring hard-to-reach locations and autonomous data collection. Particular attention is then paid to comparing the use of drones in the Czech Republic and abroad and their benefits in the field of innovative technologies that help improve the safety and efficiency of urban services. The article also analyses the technical specifications of drones and their role in the public and private sectors, considering the legislative framework for their use. Overall, the article offers an overview of how drones contribute to integrating modern technologies into the daily functioning of smart cities and improving residents' quality of life. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Drones are increasingly adopted for policing in many countries, as they can aid police officers to detect hazards and respond to incidents with timely and low-cost services. However, the planning and deployment of police drones are subject to several challenges, including the proper distance metric for drone flying and the risk-based location optimisation of drone base stations. This study proposes a new framework that enables the optimal deployment of police drones to address crime risk issues on urban street networks. This risk-based decision framework takes into account three potential distance metrics that regulate and shape the flying routes of drones, which in turn affects the optimal location of drone base stations. In addition, this framework takes into account the major risk constraints of flying drones in urban areas, including domestic privacy and elevation. The proposed risk-based decision framework is validated using the real case study of Liverpool with historical crime data and street network layouts. The findings contribute to the operations and management of police drones in urban areas and shift the paradigm of policing drones towards a risk-based regime. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Combating crime and conditions of high physical risk in cities, the environment, and critical infrastructures requires a multifaceted approach. For sensitive problems, such as advanced situational awareness in the fields of civilian applications and environmental protection, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Neural Network (NN) adoption has been slow due to concerns about their reliability, leading to several algorithms for explaining their decisions. Despite the possibilities for AI in critical infrastructure protection and civilian applications, many challenges still exist. For instance: (i) there are complex and high risks meaning that AI systems need to be transparent and interpretable to gain decision-maker trust; (ii) AI models may be vulnerable to imperceptible manipulations of input data even without any knowledge about the AI technique that is used; (iii) the need to efficiently process distributed, multimodal and big data coming from different, but however cheap, Internet of Things (IoT) and sensory devices (e.g., drones, cameras, accelerometers, telemetry, geomagnetic field, and proximity sensors); and (iv) many AI methods based on Machine Learning (ML) require huge amounts of training data, resulting in a Big Data computation problem. We introduce, benchmark, and demonstrate an adversarial explanations approach that we can efficiently tackle both adversarial robustness and explanation complexity of AI systems. To achieve this, we train robustified NNs and transparent explainers on big imagery data and leverage the attacks' knowledge as explanations to gain greater fidelity to the AI model. The merit of the proposed approach is that the new and robustified model has a great performance against new, unseen types of perturbations and attacks. This way, we pave the adoption of more informed and responsible AI integration in sensitive application domains. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Our Indian government has set a goal of creating 100 smart cities that will use smart technology such as smart grids, smart phones, and various monitoring devices to generate large amount of data. Traditionally, data centres have been in charge of these files. One of the most pressing issues in data centres is resource management. One efficient strategy to address this issue is to use the best method for handling data, and when we're talking about Smart Cities, which will create a big quantity of data, it's becoming increasingly important to manage this massive amount of data. It is also necessary to provide the better living standard for every citizen in the smart cities by providing good safety and security to them as well. As we know that every citizen is not smart enough to protect himself against the physical as well as cyber-crimes. In this paper, we have designed an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) based safety and security system for the human beings and their personal data in a smart city. The system architecture is designed with AI module with machine learning algorithms, IoT technology and sensors, smart drones, intelligent video surveillances, data analytics and cyber security modules. This system can efficiently protect the citizens and their personal data against the criminals with high speed and accuracy. © 2022 by the Dr. Nitika Vats Doohan, Dr. Sandeep Kadam, Dr. Rajesh Phursule, Dr. Vinod S.

MDLRP-UM arises in various practical applications, including daily police patrols in urban residential areas, forest fire patrols, urban infrastructure status monitoring and data collection, traffic flow monitoring at important intersections, and monitoring of urban temperature and humidity, among others. These diverse applications can be modeled as a general mixed-integer quadratically constrained problem (MIQCP), where we jointly plan the service routes of the UAVs, the frequency on each route, and the location of the depots to minimize the total cost. To solve the proposed problem, we decompose it into a master problem and sub-problems. We then propose an iterative algorithm (termed as “Frequency-Time-Frequency Strategy”) to solve the sub-problems, which is to find the optimal frequency and corresponding single service time for a given single route. The “Frequency-Time-Frequency Strategy” is further nested within a tailored adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) based heuristic algorithm to solve the master problem. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution method are demonstrated by a series of numerical studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Beyond the many advantages which Smart City brings, the issue of security and privacy remain very important concerns. As things get more interconnected, cyber orchestrated crimes such as cyberterrorism may become more prevalent. For example, an autonomous vehicle or drone may be used to commit acts of terrorism, such as driving or flying into a crowd. Responses to such incidents need to be swift and likewise smart. Law enforcement needs to be equipped with the necessary tools to respond speedily and even automatically, equally taking advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT). We propose a Sensor-Based Crime and Incident Watch for Smart Cities (SBCI-Watch), leveraging Human Activity Recognition (HAR). SBCI-Watch may be used to automatically detect and possibly report occurrences of public disturbances (likely caused by acts of terrorism or similar crimes) to foster swift response. Slightly similar reports exist, but they are focused on different topics, such as helping law enforcement to pick suitable officers to respond to crime scenes based on proximity, but without attempting to automatically detect crimes. We are using the sensor-based approach; it is less privacy intrusive compared to the vision-based method, which is dominant in the public surveillance area but also more privacy intrusive and more expensive. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address the problem in this fashion, and the results illustrate the viability of the SBCI-Watch. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2023.},

	abstract = {Direction finding(DF) and positioning of frequency modulation(FM) transmitting station with known frequency are important technology of FM broadcast supervision. In recent years, illegal radio stations across the country have emerged endlessly, resulting in adverse social impact. These illegal radio stations are generally small in size and concealed, especially in the urban environment where the buildings are so high that they are difficult to be investigated and dealt with. To solve this problem, this paper introduces the method of three-dimensional positioning of FM radio by using multi rotor unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) equipped with radio DF equipment. At the same time, the composition and principle of the UAV DF and positioning system are expounded, and the hardware structure and software function are given, which provides a new technical means for the monitoring and positioning of the FM radio station. © 2017 IEEE.},

Even though crackdowns on illegal radio stations are conducted on a regular basis every year, the number of illegal emission cases still tends to increase, as ordinary citizens are now able to handle advanced wireless communication technologies, e.g., via software-defined radio. However, the current surveillance system may not be able to accurately detect the source in areas where large buildings are densely packed, such as urban areas, due to the effects of reflected waves. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a system for estimating the location of the source of transmission using a high-flying unmanned aerial vehicle called HAPS. The simulation results using numerical analysis software show that the proposed system can estimate the location of the source over a wider area and with higher accuracy than conventional monitoring systems. © 2024 by the authors.},

During daytime, they rest on urban light posts, expanding their solar panels for charging. At night, they interact with individuals walking on the street in their own way based on their distinct personalities. Twinkles are indirect solutions for improving urban safety without surveillance.

	abstract = {The urban illegal buildings have seriously disrupted the urban land planning and development space, even having serious security risks. How accurately and comprehensively identifying the illegal buildings is very important for their management and planning. The traditional method of identifying illegal buildings is inefficient and high consumption. Learning-based methods can improve efficiency and save resources but a high miss rate. In response to the above problem, this paper proposes an illegal building recognition method based on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) images: IBR-Yolov5 (Illegal Building Recognition with UAV Image Based on Improved YOLOv5). IBR-Yolov5 appends SPP (Spatial Pyramid Pooling) based on stochastic pooling to the Backbone module. Meanwhile, CBAM(Convolutional Block Attention Module) is used to highlight the main features and suppress irrelevant features, which can ultimately improve the detection accuracy of IBR-Yolov5. In addition, IBR-Yolov5 combined with BiFPN (Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network) can fuse features extracted by different layers of networks to reduce feature loss. Experimental results show that the miss detection rate of the proposed improved model is lower in comparison with the original YOLOv5, and detection precision has been improved.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Multi-centred governance is epitomised in current struggles to better ‘secure’ liberal democracies as nation state actors are obliged to act ‘in partnership’ with corporate and non-governmental organisations whilst confronting illicit actors with enhanced digital capacities to circumvent and organisationally outflank both state and corporate powers. Examples of such social technologies, particularly Disruptive Digital Technologies (DDTs), include the use of social media communications for challenging elite constructions of social problems, networked distributed manufacturing technologies for the ‘weaponisation’ of civil society and the use of unmanned airborne vehicles (UAV’s) or ‘drones’ for surveillance and counter-surveillance. The paper draws upon research into transnational organised crime and urban security in Europe to illustrate the circuits of power that constitute liberal modes of security through causal relations of power-dependence, dispositions that fix or re-fix the meaning and membership categories of security and technologies of production and discipline that can facilitate the disruption or reproduction of these causes and dispositions. © 2016 The Author(s).

Simultaneously, the fear of terrorism and crime in such public spaces is ever-increasing. Due to the resulting increased demand for security, video-based IoT surveillance systems have become an important area for research. Considering the large number of devices involved in the illicit recognition task, we conducted a field study in a Dutch Easter music festival in a national interest project called VISOR to select the most appropriate device configuration in terms of performance and results. We iteratively architected solutions for the security of cyber–physical spaces using IoT devices. We tested the performance of multiple federated devices encompassing drones, closed-circuit television, smart phone cameras, and smart glasses to detect real-case scenarios of potentially malicious activities such as mosh pits and pick-pocketing. Our results pave the way to select optimal IoT architecture configurations—that is, a mix of CCTV, drones, smart glasses, and camera phones in our case—to make safer cyber–physical spaces' a reality. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are being enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G. ITSs have the potential to enhance roadway security in smart cities. As a result, ITSs are gaining traction in both the industry and academia. Vehicle numbers are increasing due to the fast growth in population. As a result, the frequency of traffic accidents is growing. The majority of the moment, accidents aren't identified or communicated to nearby hospitals and family in an appropriate manner. This absence of prompt medical attention and first assistance. In a matter of minutes, you might lose your life. To handle all of these issues, an intelligent system is required. Although numerous ICT-based solutions for identifying accidents and rescue efforts have been offered, these systems are not interoperable with every vehicle and are also expensive. As a result, we presented a smart city accident detection and reporting system (ADR) that is less costly and compatible with any vehicle. Our plan strives to enhance the quality of transportation while keeping costs reasonable. In this context, we created a simulation that gathers information from the sensors about pressure, acceleration, captures moment, location of the occurrence, and force of the accident. The measure of speed contributes to the accuracy of accident recognition. The information gathered is then analysed for accident identification. A GPS system should also alert relatives, the police, and the closest medical center. The hospital sends a UAV (drone) along with a first aid kit and a motor ambulance to accident location. The road transport and roads accident repository's real dataset are used to produce simulation results. The proposed plan shows promise when measured against current approaches in terms of accuracy and response time. © 2024 Little Lion Scientific. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {UAVs are expected to be extensively used in many applications related to modern transportation systems, e.g., traffic monitoring, flying police-eye, and flying roadside units. However, it is important to note that UAVs can also be maliciously utilized as a threat to public safety and pose a significant risk to the stability and execution of smart city applications. Detection of flying intruders can be performed using various sensors such as cameras, RADAR, and LIDAR. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for UAV detection and classification using ground cameras. First, we use YOLOv8 for detecting UAVs, and then we use an unsupervised clustering approach to classify the detected objects according to their different categories. The clustering process is performed by extracting the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features of the detected UAVs. Afterward, the features are embedded by mapping them into a two-dimensional space where the separation of the classes is possible. To this end, we use the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) approach. Our framework is tested on an anti-intrusion UAV unlabeled dataset where we identify all categories of UAVs within that dataset. Our approach has shown remarkable clustering performance compared to existing machine-learning methods.  © 2023 IEEE.},

The path planning of UAV/UGV is one of the most important issues in the cooperative detection system, and its studies have attracted great attentions in recent years. In this study, a two-level memetic path planning algorithm is proposed to help the unmanned air/ground vehicle cooperative systems detect realistic urban illegal building, considering the limits of the endurance capacity of the UAV, the load capacity of the UGV, and the communication restrictions between them.

	abstract = {This paper proposes an international effort to pair the autonomous precision-flight capabilities of micro-UAVs with the growing capability of artificial intelligence (specifically AI based on neuromorphic computing systems) to field cyber-secure, active-shooter response systems to counter the active shooter threat to urban population centers. Recent developments in technology, as well as growing political acceptance of autonomous systems, would likely support the immediate use of autonomous drones to enhance the situational awareness of first responders. The paper goes further, however, and makes a theoretical case for disrupting terrorist attacks with a micro-UAV armed with less than lethal weapons, like a stun gun, and eventually for using lethal force once such systems are proven to be cyber-secure. Assuring that such a system would be trustworthy and correctly engage only active shooters is likely within the cyber capabilities of the United States, its NATO partners and other allies. Currently, however, it is not clear that international acceptance would meet even a demonstrably cyber-secure “killer mini-drone”. How might we trust taser-armed micro-UAVs to wake up to the sound of gunshots and then identify and neutralize an active shooter within seconds, without zapping an innocent bystander? Promise lies with “neuromorphic” computing systems, which have benefitted from neuroscience-informed projects like the U.S. DARPA “Synapse” project and are currently amazing the world as drivers for IBM’s Watson (True North chip) and Google’s DeepMind system. Despite the promise of the technology, any system would have to be assessed in the context of the law of armed conflict, as well as the laws and culture of the countries involved. The paper concludes by making a case for a pragmatic, predictable path to acceptance of such systems by building on pilots in the context of non-lethal, fully-autonomous systems for disaster response, fire-fighting and law-enforcement in urban areas. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will open up new application fields in smart city-based intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), e.g., traffic management, disaster rescue, police patrol, etc. However, the broadcast and line-of-sight nature of air-to-ground wireless channels give rise to a new challenge to the information security of UAV-to-vehicle (U2V) communications. This paper considers U2V communications subject to multi-eavesdroppers on the ground in urban scenarios. We aim to maximize the secrecy rates in physical layer security perspective while considering both the energy consumption and flight zone limitation, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and the jamming power sent by the roadside unit (RSU). This joint optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), considering time-varying characteristics of the wireless channels. A curiosity-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is subsequently utilized to solve the above MDP, in which the agent is reinforced by an extrinsic reward supplied by the environment and an intrinsic reward defined as the prediction error of the consequence after executing its actions. Extensive simulation results show that compared to the DRL without intrinsic rewards, the proposed scheme can have excellent performance in terms of the average reward, learning efficiency, and generalization to other scenarios. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We present a spatiotemporal data set of all out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrests (OHCA) dispatches for the City of Virginia Beach.We also develop a modular toolkit that can be used to process the data and generate problem instances based on user-defined input. The data were collected from multiple sources, and our analysis process was validated by Virginia Beach officials. The data set consists of detailed information about each dispatch made in response to an OHCA; it includes the time the call for service arrived, the response time of the first unit on scene, the address, and the coordinates of each OHCA incident. It also contains detailed spatial information for all existing first-responder stations and both the great-circle and the road distances between all first-responder stations and OHCA incidents. The raw data files were very large in size and were processed using SAS®, MATLAB, and QGIS. In conjunction with the database, we provide a MATLAB code that allows generating multiple random test instances based on user-defined input. The library of problems can be used in healthcare emergency problems and also for facility location models, bilocation problems, and drone studies. The data set was organized such that it can be readily used by researchers in the field of healthcare operations research and those studying the spatiotemporal distribution of OHCAs. Given the difficulty to access OHCA data at the level of detail we provide, the data set will facilitate the implementation of data-driven models to design emergency medical response networks and to study the distribution of OHCAs. Additionally, the provision of data and the toolkit will be very useful in benchmarking algorithms and solvers, which is valuable to the data-driven optimization community in general. Summary of Contribution: The paper provides a data set of spatiotemporal information out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) for the City of Virginia Beach. The complete data set also includes spatial information about all fire, emergency medical services, and police stations in the city and both the road and haversine distances between each pair of stations and OHCA incident. Additionally, we provide a toolkit to generate random instances based on user input. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that an OHCA database is made publicly available in such level of detail, and there is no precedent of such in IJOC. OHCAs are a leading cause of death worldwide, and emergency medical services still encounter difficulties in providing care in a timely manner. Given the criticality of OHCAs, we believe that making this data set publicly available can help the implementation of data-driven models by researchers in the field of operations research.

	abstract = {Swarms of police drones, fleets of overhead delivery bots, and flocks of private security drones are set to multiply the complex interfaces between state, capital, and sense. This paper explores the military and economic enclosure of the atmosphere by drones. For centuries, capitalist enclosure has privatized and secured common spaces: territorializing new power relations into the soil. Enclosure now operates through an increasingly atmospheric spatiality. The birth of airpower enabled new vertical regimes of state power, capital accumulation, and violence. Now, drones are materializing both intimate and pervasive colonizations of local, national, and international airspace. Crucially, this discloses new morphologies and ontologies of urban (in)security, in which an atmospheric state polices deterritorialized aerial circulations. Such a reenchanted atmosphere collapses the geopolitical and geoeconomic in uncertain robotic orbits. This paper, which connects past and present, is driven by a deeper concern for the existential dimensions of dronified skyscapes, subjects, and violence. © 2017 The Authors.

In this paper, we focus on the self-flying planes (drones), which have been renamed Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) by the US Federal Aviation Agency (FAA). The most controversial operations envisaged by the UAS industry are small, low-altitude UAS flights in densely populated cities - robotic aircraft flying in the midst of public spaces to deliver goods and information. This subset of robotic flight would be the most valuable to the nation's economy, but we argue that it cannot happen without a new generation of air traffic control and management services.

	abstract = {This paper explores the urbanization of drone warfare and the securitization of the “surplus population”. Defined as a bloc of humanity rendered as structurally unnecessary to a capital-intensive economy, the surplus population is an emerging target for the post-welfare security state. If we now live in an age of a permanent conflict with uncertain geographies, then it is at least partly fueled by this endemic crisis at the heart of the capitalist world system. Of key significance is the contradictory nature of the surplus population. The “security threat” generated by replacing masses of workers with nonhumans is increasingly managed by policing humans with robots, drones, and other apparatuses. In other words, the surplus population is both the outcome and target of contemporary capitalist technics. The emerging “dronification of state violence” across a post-9/11 battlespace has seen police drones deployed to the urban spaces of cities in Europe and North America. The drone, with its ability to swarm in the streets of densely packed urban environments, crystallizes a more intimate and invasive form of state power. The project of an atmospheric, dronified form of policing not only embodies the technologization of state security but also entrenches the logic of a permanent, urbanized manhunt. The paper concludes by discussing the rise of the dronepolis: the city of the drone. © Author(s) 2016. This work is distributed.},

	abstract = {The maintenance of municipal facilities has always been an important public affairs, in order to ensure the smooth traffic and driving safety of the city, it is necessary to carry out regular inspection of the road surface and traffic signs. The use of drone inspection can find problems such as uneven road surface and illegal parking, so as to avoid traffic congestion and accidents. In this paper, a control method based on the combination of model predictive control and event triggering is proposed to control the trajectory tracking of the four-rotor UAV. The control method of model predictive control (MPC) enables the four-rotor UAV to track the preset path well. In addition, the original four-rotor UAV dynamic model is simplified, and the event-triggered control idea designed in this paper solves the problem of excessive consumption of communication resources in model predictive control well, and provides conditions for installing functions such as visual processing and infrared remote sensing on the UAV in subsequent municipal maintenance. The simulation results show that the proposed control scheme can better track the reference trajectory of the quadrotor and reduce the consumption of communication resources. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial in smart cities, especially in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). With the increasing reliance on technology in transportation systems, the risk of cyber-attacks and data breaches increases, making IDS an important aspect of ITS security. IDS systems monitor network traffic and detect any suspicious or malicious activity. In the context of ITS, IDS can detect unauthorized access to transportation systems, unauthorized changes to data or configurations, and other types of security incidents. This information can then be used to alert security personnel and prevent potential threats from causing damage. Reinforcement Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (RL-IDS) have gained increasing attention in recent years as means of improving the performance of traditional intrusion detection systems. RL-IDS uses reinforcement learning algorithms to train an agent to detect intrusions by maximizing a reward signal. In this survey, we give an overview of the traditional intrusion detection systems, their limitations, and how reinforcement learning overcomes these challenges to build more robust IDS. Next, we explore state-of-the-art research in RL-IDS for smart cities. Finally, we provide insights into future directions for research in RL-IDS for smart cities and highlight the potential benefits of these systems for enhancing the security of these environments.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With aims of providing a service for people travelling by foot in crime-stricken neighbor-hoods, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) must be developed capable of following a person through said environments. In cities especially, obstructions may cause global positioning system (GPS)-based and vision-based navigation to fail while following a person, or walker, for the extended period of flight time required for this mission. In order to address this is-sue, a velocity controller interfaced with PX4 flight controller firmware was designed which uses the walker’s measured velocity, likely obtained in a finalized design through a smart-phone’s accelerometer and gyroscope, to maintain the last recorded distance to the target. This is accomplished by taking in the walker’s velocity and converting this into commands which mimic the motion of the walker. Additionally, a controller was designed which uses the angle between the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the walker, with respect to the east-axis, as well as UAV distance to walker to create velocity commands that reduce said distance to a desired value. In summary, the autopilot proposed runs in tiers, where if GPS fails, vision based navigation provides a fail safe or vice versa. Further, a second fail safe is provided that uses target-velocity based navigation until another sensor’s information becomes available. Experiments were ran to verify the validity of both controllers. The results of these tests indicate that a UAV would be able to maintain its distance to the target for short periods of time, and that the method described is an adequate replacement to hovering after loss of visual. Further, the UAV, using relative angle and distance, was able to successfully fly within the desired distance zone and maintain that approximate distance for the rest of the experiment. � 2019 by German Aerospace Center (DLR).

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are adaptable and rapid mobile boards that can be applied to several purposes, especially in smart cities. These involve traffic observation, environmental monitoring, and public safety. The need to realize effective drone forensic processes has mainly been reinforced by drone-based evidence. Drone-based evidence collection and preservation entails accumulating and collecting digital evidence from the drone of the victim for subsequent analysis and presentation. Digital evidence must, however, be collected and analyzed in a forensically sound manner using the appropriate collection and analysis methodologies and tools to preserve the integrity of the evidence. For this purpose, various collection and analysis models have been proposed for drone forensics based on the existing literature; several models are inclined towards specific scenarios and drone systems. As a result, the literature lacks a suitable and standardized drone-based collection and analysis model devoid of commonalities, which can solve future problems that may arise in the drone forensics field. Therefore, this paper has three contributions: (a) studies the machine learning existing in the literature in the context of handling drone data to discover criminal actions, (b) highlights the existing forensic models proposed for drone forensics, and (c) proposes a novel comprehensive collection and analysis forensic model (CCAFM) applicable to the drone forensics field using the design science research approach. The proposed CCAFM consists of three main processes: (1) acquisition and preservation, (2) reconstruction and analysis, and (3) post-investigation process. CCAFM contextually leverages the initially proposed models herein incorporated in this study. CCAFM allows digital forensic investigators to collect, protect, rebuild, and examine volatile and nonvolatile items from the suspected drone based on scientific forensic techniques. Therefore, it enables sharing of knowledge on drone forensic investigation among practitioners working in the forensics domain. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Crime is heterogeneously distributed and occurs at the most vulnerable places. Crime occurs under poor surveillance and safety, due to lack of public protection and results in damage to public property or human life, and creates a public discrepancy in that particular location. Crime is disastrous because of its unpredictability and unpreparedness for enforcement officers. Finding the probability of occurrence of crimes within such vulnerabilities will help us to deploy certain countermeasures to reduce crime. Crime is limited to location and place. Geographically crime can be considered as a function of lack of surveillance, delay in mobility and control, and probably hidden escape paths utilized by criminals. In this research, a Spatio-Statistical Model was developed for probability-based Crime Prediction using past data and location intelligence technology. Neighborhood Analysis was performed to evaluate the clustering distance between individual crime occurrences within Vadodara city and individual police stations in the neighborhood. The spatial distance is converted into Geographical Coordinate System to calculate latitudinal and longitudinal extents of crime zones in each taluka of the city, which is then utilized to create the Interpolated probability raster for each crime zone with a pixel value equivalent to the probability of occurrence of crime in that location. The Inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation technique generated an interpolated surface which was then represented spatially with quantile divisions to form probability zones with the adjoining nearest police jurisdiction. This will enable law enforcement officers to make probability-based surveillance decisions while incorporating the past data intelligence, time of occurrence of crime, and make efficient serviceable patrolling routes and improve crime control with minimal resources. Using this model, the police officers will be able to create patrol routes based on time and zone of highest probability of crime, to ensure safety. The time-based probability of crime is also calculated using the Bayesian probability formula to get the peak crime hours so that surveillance need to be increased at the appropriate time. UAVs mounted with thermal vision can be deployed in the generated high probability zones at the highest probable time of the crime, to monitor the situation aerially without alarming the criminals. In this research it is created an open-source pixel-based route selection algorithm that could identify hotspot locations of crime so that law enforcement officers can watch human movements and follow them silently using UAV’s thermal camera in nighttime also to obtain their hideouts and catch criminals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a wide application in transportation. For instance, by leveraging it, we are able to perform accurate and real-time vehicle speed detection in an IoT-based smart city. Although numerous vehicle speed estimation methods exist, most of them lack real-time detection in different situations and scenarios. To fill the gap, this paper introduces a novel low-altitude vehicle speed detector system using UAVs for remote sensing applications of smart cities, forging to increase traffic safety and security. To this aim, (1) we have found the best possible Raspberry PI’s field of view (FOV) camera in indoor and outdoor scenarios by changing its height and degree. Then, (2) Mobile Net-SSD deep learning model parameters have been embedded in the PI4B processor of a physical car at different speeds. Finally, we implemented it in a real environment at the JXUST university intersection by changing the height (0.7 to 3 m) and the camera angle on the UAV. Specifically, this paper proposed an intelligent speed control system without the presence of real police that has been implemented on the edge node with the configuration of a PI4B and an Intel Neural Computing 2, along with the PI camera, which is armed with a Mobile Net-SSD deep learning model for the smart detection of vehicles and their speeds. The main purpose of this article is to propose the use of drones as a tool to detect the speeds of vehicles, especially in areas where it is not easy to access or install a fixed camera, in the context of future smart city traffic management and control. The experimental results have proven the superior performance of the proposed low-altitude UAV system rather than current studies for detecting and estimating the vehicles’ speeds in highly dynamic situations and different speeds. As the results showed, our solution is highly effective on crowded roads, such as junctions near schools, hospitals, and with unsteady vehicles from the speed level point of view. © 2023 by the authors.},

Micro UAVs can detect and avoid obstacles using onboard cameras; nevertheless, disturbances such as wind gusts, operator error, or failure of onboard vision can still result in dangerous collisions with objects. In the urban setting, the most predominant obstacles are walls and poles. With the aim of developing collision recovery control solutions for quadrotor UAVs, this paper investigates the collision dynamics between a propeller-protected quadrotor UAV and a vertical pole. Simulations provide insight into a quadrotor's post-collision dynamics and experimental trials demonstrate the feasibility of autonomously recovering to stable flight using only inertial onboard sensing in real-time. © 2018 IEEE.},

Moreover, the data acquisition platform of photogrammetry is evolving from manned aircraft to UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). However, it is very costly and time-consuming to detect unregistered buildings from UAV images since the interpretation of aerial images still relies on manual efforts. To overcome this problem, we propose a system which automatically detects unregistered buildings from UAV images based on deep learning methods. Specifically, we train a deconvolutional network with publicly opened geospatial data, semantically segment a given UAV image into a building probability map and compare the building map with existing GIS data. Through this procedure, we could detect unregistered buildings from UAV images automatically and efficiently. We expect that the proposed system can be applied for various urban management tasks such as monitoring illegal buildings or illegal land-use change. © Authors 2018.},

	abstract = {To address the problem that current target detection algorithms do not work well in the task of detecting illegal building targets in the ancient city, a YOLO-UB-based algorithm for illegal building detection and recognition in the ancient city is proposed based on remote sensing image data taken by UAV. The algorithm incorporates the Coordinate attention (CA) attention mechanism to improve network robustness enhance the model's detection ability for illegal building targets, and make target localization more accurate, and introduces the Swin Transformer V2 structure to use its own self-attention mechanism to deeply mine the target features, which enhances the global information capture capability and enables the network to better integrate multi-scale features. The algorithm is trained iteratively on a custom dataset and compared with other models. The results show that this algorithm achieves an average accuracy (mAP) of 96.8% in detecting illegal building targets, Compared to the algorithm with YOLOv7, the accuracy is improved by 3.1%, and the algorithm has better featureextraction, robustness and generalization than other target detection models.  © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {This paper uses the metaphor of ‘boomerangs’ articulated by Michel Foucault to discuss the potential for drones to become the ‘next layer’ of urban surveillance in our cities. Like earlier Western technologies and techniques of government that were ‘tested out’ in foreign warzones and then ‘brought back’ to urban centres (the helicopter and its utilization in Vietnam and its return to urban police forces is a clear illustration hereof), contemporary unmanned aerial vehicles hold the potential to act as proverbial ‘Foucauldian boomerangs’ and return from warzones in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan to Western cities. The paper explores how a nexus of Surveillance Studies and mobilities research may be a fruitful way into comprehending this new phenomenon. En route the practical applications of drones as well as the historical importance of aerial power are connected to a situational understanding of mobilities. The paper points at a number of challenges for the future and should be understood as a first tentative attempt to set this on the research agenda. © The author, 2016.},

	abstract = {With the rise of new and innovative Urban Air Mobility solutions, there also arises a need to integrate these into the existing airspace. Current airspace users include conventional civil, commercial and general aviation, military air users, police and emergency services as well as a plethora of avian life. Planned additions to the airspace are electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles such as logistics drones and air taxis. The airspace for conventional users is stringently controlled. Urban Air Mobility operations are expected to mainly take place in individual corridors to be added to the currently uncontrolled low-level airspace. This airspace is also intended for various types of drone operations, out of which, small-scale drones can be non-co-operative. In addition, the operational altitudes of Urban Air Mobility aircraft will strongly expose them to birds. Due to abundance of these non-cooperating airspace users (like hobby-drones and birds), conflicts with Urban Air Mobility aircraft are expected to be inevitable. The aim of this paper is to develop a concept of Urban Air Mobility Collision Avoidance System to reduce the likelihood of collision between air taxis and non-cooperating airspace users. As such, this work proposes the introduction of an additional safety layer to prevent collisions during operations of strong exposure. The concept consists of a conflict detection and resolution method tailored for Urban Air Mobility operations. A three-dimensional safety envelope is designed using the geometric and performance values of the aircraft configurations currently available. Procedures to avoid conflicts prior to as well as during the flights are presented. Finally, the concept is visualized for the common use case of a shuttle service between an airport and a railway station. The results demonstrate the importance of incorporating individual aircraft configuration into conflict avoidance approach and report its effect to avoid collision. © 2022 ICAS.

This study derived intelligent Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) services and suggested a decision model based on the fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to implement these services in municipal control centers. The analysis results are summarized as follows. First, this study established a fuzzy TOPSIS-based decision-making support model enabling local government control centers to effectively select intelligent CPTED service elements. Second, overall, operator-led Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) and platform control technologies were identified as significant components of intelligent CPTED service elements. Third, a comparison by city size revealed that large cities in the Seoul metropolitan area rated system services for control based on advanced crime prevention infrastructure (e.g., the crime monitoring systems and real-time control drones/robots) relatively higher. In contrast, small and medium-sized cities in other provinces rated services that were perceptible to residents and improved crime-prone environments (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI) video analysis for living safety) relatively higher. © 2024 by the authors.},

The development of human-friendly drones and IoT technology enables automated city supervision, while the integration of AI allows for immediate reports and actions, overcoming human limitations. Drones can continuously monitor different areas, detecting crime hotspots and providing a substitute for city policies. This smart surveillance system can improve emergency management and ensure a regulated and competent surveillance management approach. Ultimately, this technology can enhance the safety and security of smart towns, making them more effective, efficient, and reliable. The framework of the suggested intelligent surveillance system relies on the utilization of real-time data collection and analysis, integrating drone technology, IoT devices, and AI. The research showcases the system’s efficacy in identifying and addressing criminal activities, making it an invaluable resource for law enforcement agencies. By combining these technologies, surveillance management can become more dependable and effective, ultimately contributing to the advancement of safer and smarter cities.

These results show the ethical themes that were operative in such discussions: privacy, safety, enforceability, crime, nuisance and professionality. Underlying most of these themes is trust. We discuss this concept with respect to the good society, and we suggest that trust may be more critical to emerging technologies than technologies in general. That is, trust in an emerging technology is required for it to be accepted and more fully integrated in society.

DSMs are useful in wide-scope of various applications such as 3D building modelling and reconstruction, cultural heritage, urban and environmental planning, aircraft navigation/path routing, accident and crime scene reconstruction, mining as well as, topographic map revision and change detection. For these listed applications, it is not uncommon that there will be a need for automatically aligning multi-Temporal DSMs which may have been acquired from multiple sensors, with different specifications over a period of time, and may have various overlaps. Terrestrial laser scanners usually capture urban facades in an accurate manner; however this is not the case for building roof structures. On the other hand, vertical photography from UAVs can capture the roofs.

I use the Dallas incident to probe the cogency and limits of ‘drone theory’ and to consider its application in domestic policing contexts. I work through three broadly delineated areas of scepticism about drone theory as it intersects with policing and, in so doing, develop my own account of the weaponized policing drone as a defining techno-cultural element within the emergent form of neoliberal political rationality I call ‘governance’. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {This paper considers using a team of solar-powered UAVs to collaboratively eavesdrop on a mobile ground target in an urban environment. A practical application is that the police department uses UAVs to collect the transmitted data from a criminal suspect so that the transmitted content can be understood. Using UAVs in this task is a much more cost-effective and also less suspicious option than the conventional surveillance by a police helicopter. We focus on the online and decentralized path planning for the solar-powered UAV team. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem which forces the UAVs to complete the uninterrupted eavesdropping task, not enter any No-fly space (NFS), keep a safe distance from each other and harvest as much energy as possible. We propose a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) based path planning method, consisting of an initial planning phase and an online planning phase. In the online planning phase, each UAV plans its own path based on the shared information across the team. Since the UAV model can be taken into account in the planning phase, the obtained UAV paths are feasible without any later adjustment. More importantly, this method is easily implementable in real-time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Rapid developments in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have emerged as a new research field for building sustainable smart cities. VANET (vehicular ad hoc network) is one of the emergent transportation technologies that has a great impact on ensuring mainly traffic management and road safety in urban areas by efficiently using data sharing among vehicles. To further increase the security and safety of passengers and drivers, ITSs are continually striving to make the fusion of emergent network technologies to provide more reliable and efficient services. Relating VANET to UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is an example of this fusion, where UAVs act as an assistant to vehicles aiming to extend the network connectivity while efficiently avoiding obstacles (e.g., Buildings) and providing high data delivery ratios. However, VANET and UAV are still critical security subjects that must be addressed. Advanced Machine Learning (e.g., Deep Learning) techniques have recently been used to protect VANET and UAV communications against various cyber attacks that deteriorate the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of vehicular data. Thus, in this paper, we focus on reviewing related work on machine learning techniques for intrusion detection systems in VANET- and UAV-aided networks. We also highlight the main open research challenges in literature and provide hints for improving security in ITSs. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The Road health management is particularly important, especially for big cities and countries. Problems that occur on roads like road cracks can be extremely dangerous to drivers' and passengers' lives. In this paper, a road monitoring system is proposed to detect and classify the occurring problems on the road that happened due to obstacles, such as excavations. This work will help in repairing critical road damages faster and save people from accidents that are caused by these damages. The proposed model will detect and classify the problem related to road damage into categories (cracks, potholes, and other damages). This proposed model will be built using a deep learning technique which is convolutional neural networks (CNN). It has been found that CNN is widely used in this area and images detection and classification because it shows high performance. Numerous works have been done in this field, but it is hoped that this proposed technique will achieve better results. The proposed model will be connected with a drone, and it is linked to a web application to demonstrate the results and manage the system. Also, an announcement to government agencies such as the Ministry of Transportation or police could be sent using the web application. Theoretically, the outcomes from of this work shall demonstrate extremely reasonable findings in detecting and classifying road damages from real-time recording. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The universal applicability of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in the civil and commercial sectors offers enormous potential to transform urban and rural infrastructure, improving efficiency and effectiveness while reducing associated costs. For the successful operation of a remotely or autonomously controlled UAV, satellite navigation plays a crucial role in ensuring stable and reliable air navigation. One of the oldest and probably best known navigation satellite systems is the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS). Unfortunately, many cyber attacks against UAVs are strongly associated with civil GPS vulnerabilities. The market growth of UAVs and the vulnerability of GPS are leading to more critical flight movements near or in no-fly-zones, which in turn has significant safety risks in a dynamic and complex environment such as aviation. In this paper, an experimental GPS spoofing system was developed and implemented for geospatial guidance of UAVs around predefined no-fly-zones using an algorithm to determine the shortest feasible path. For this reason, a cyber attack analysis of GPS was performed first. Followed by the theory and application of fake signal generation and emission in laboratory environments. Based on the obtained and valuable knowledge, three corresponding algorithms for real time spoofing, shortest way spoofing and UAV no-fly-zone were elaborated and implemented. Finally, the developed geospatial guidance algorithm is illustrated in a real life scenario to show the problem by entering critical areas. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Management of demographic records plays a vital role in understanding and planning for the needs of community living. However, managing conventional records requires more time, cost, and energy without accurate assurance. As there are raising concerns in assessing community information for charity purposes, safety coordination, and crime prevention, especially during emergencies; integrating demographic data with spatial information is becoming significantly important. This paper aims to establish an accessible and visible digital platform of demographic information for respective sectors, namely, the KRT, Qariah group, NGOs, and representatives of CSR projects. The objective is to digitize interactive demographic record management and mapping through GIS-based technology. This study adopts a Geographical Information System (GIS) to digitize information using web GIS integrating with the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology for data acquisition in the community sampling areas; Puncak Iskandar. The proposed system which leverages the power of spatial analysis and visualization, utilizes GIS technology to store, analyse, and visualize demographic records in a geographical context. It incorporates various demographic data sources, such as census data, health records, and administrative data in managing more efficient and effective data with lower cost, energy, time, and resources. Furthermore, the GIS-based system enables the identification of spatial disparities, inequalities, and interventions in demographic characteristics. Therefore, the integration of this system into community demographic management has provided a powerful platform for accessing and coordinating population dynamics, problem-solving, and sustainable development. The implementation in Puncak Iskandar enhances the accessibility, and visualization of demographic data, enabling policy-makers, researchers, and planners to make informed decisions based on a geographical perspective. The findings demonstrate the reliability of GIS-based demographic record management in a community living towards supporting evidence-based planning, resource allocation, and policy formulation for a wide range of applications, including urban planning, public health, and social services towards a sustainable future. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

This led us to the development of the EDNA drone, an aerial robotics solution designed to equip first responders in high-risk settings with lifesaving-edge tools for situational awareness and non-lethal conflict resolution. The EDNA is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that delivers the patent-pending 'Predictive Probable Cause' technology. The EDNA drone is designed to provide automated real-Time analysis to assist teams entering high-risk situations where gun violence may occur. By leveraging machine learning, biometric sensors, and advanced materials in the field and routing feedback to an intuitive augmented-reality interface, the EDNA will provide autonomous threat detection and bullet-stopping capabilities wherever those features are needed-to groups such as Police and Sheriff's Departments, Fire Departments, and EMT and emergency rescue teams. Data from the EDNA drone's sensors is fed to machine learning algorithms running on the drone in real-Time. Through a neural network trained on past data, the EDNA is able to detect the presence and location of firearms and explosives, even through walls or other obstacles. Through the use of advanced metal foams and composite materials, the armored drone can even stop bullets-functionality which has obvious benefits for humanitarian deployment. © 2018 IEEE.},

The myriad of sensors could increase data collection capabilities for businesses to facilitate process automation aided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) but without adopting an appropriate Security-by-Design framework, threat detection and response are destined to fail. The emerging concept of Smart Workplace incorporates many CPS (e.g. Robots and Drones) to execute tasks alongside Employees both of which can be exploited as Insider Threats. We introduce and discuss forensic-readiness, liability attribution and the ability to track moving Smart SPS Objects to support modern Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) within a defence-in-depth strategy. We present a framework to facilitate the tracking of object behaviour within Smart Controlled Business Environments (SCBE) to support resilience by enabling proactive insider threat detection. Several components of the framework were piloted in a company to discuss a real-life case study and demonstrate anomaly detection and the emerging of behavioural patterns according to objects' movement with relation to their job role, workspace position and nearest entry or exit. The empirical data was collected from a Bluetooth-based Proximity Monitoring Solution.

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technology is one of the fastest growing technologies nowadays and is deployed in various fields. UAVs are used in many domains such as surveillance, precision agriculture, mapping and surveying, militaries etc. UAVs can move fast, it can enable the user to look past walls and fences, and it provides a large aerial view of the area where the drone flies. UAVs can also be used to harness information from dangerous places to prevent human casualties. These advantages of UAVs allow us to use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in many fields. This paper proposes a prototype of an automatic artillery system that can get GPS coordinates of a target location based on the intelligence provided by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle which spots the location of the target easily. The artillery system can be used to eject a projectile and make it fall on the target position. This system has applications like riot control in urban cities. It can also be used by police or military personnel to take control over terrorist infested areas without manually entering into the region of terror. This UAV directed artillery system is a very viable, cost efficient and effective when compared to conventional methods to control riots and counter terrorists. This system enhances peace in cities and ensures safety and security of the people. © 2022 by Muhaidheen M, Muralidharan S, Alagammal S and Vanaja N.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, violence has a major impact in society. Violence metrics increasing very rapidly reveal a very alarm-ing situation. Many violent events go unnoticed. Over the last few years, autonomous vehicles have been used to observe and recognize abnormalities in human behavior and to classify them as crimes or not. Detecting crime on live streams requires classifying an event as a crime or not a crime and generating alerts to designated authorities, who can in turn take the required actions and assess the security of the city. There is currently a need for this kind of effective techniques for live video stream processing in computer vision. There are many techniques that can be used, but Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and OpenCV provide the most accurate prediction for this task. OpenCV is used for the task of object detection in computer vision, which will take the input from either a drone or any autonomous vehicle. LSTM is used to classify any event or behavior as a crime or not. This live stream is also encrypted using the Elliptic curve algorithm for more security of data against any manipulation. Through its ability to sense its surroundings, an autonomous vehicle is able to operate itself and execute critical activities without the need for human interaction. Much crowd-based crimes like mob lynching and individual crimes like mur-der, burglary, and terrorism can be protected against with advanced deep learning-based Anamoly detection tech-niques. With this proposed system, object detection is possible with approximately 90% accuracy. After analyzing all the data, it is sent to the nearest concern department to provide the remedial approach or protect from any crime. This system helps to enhance surveillance and decrease the crime rate in society. © 2022 ® Kukad et al.},

In the midst of both contemporary protests responding to excessive police violence against African Americans and the military's use of drone airpower, "Black Media Matters" returns our attention to the 1987 documentary, The Bombing of Osage Avenue, produced and directed by Louis Massiah, written and narrated by Toni Cade Bambara. Drawing on the archives of both Massiah and Bambara, this essay explores the film as a model of a media response to black political protest, death and suffering that resists spectacularization and oversimplification, and instead fosters historical awareness and critical reflection. © 2015 by The Regents of the University of California.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), e.g., drones, have become crucial assets in the military's fleet of vehicles. UAVs can provide limited bandwidth for tactical communications and can act as relays over battlefields. Modern drones provide much higher bandwidth than their legacy predecessors with dynamic antenna capabilities that would be useful in communicating around obstacles, such as urban corridors formed by rows of tall buildings that limit terrestrial lines of sight and attenuate high frequencies. While it is still more likely that one UAV is used for this purpose, a well-managed cluster of UAVs could increase the functionality of the entire terrestrial-drone network. Software-defined networking (SDN) is recognized as an effective way to manage distributed wireless networks. In our previous research, we used a software-defined UAV (SD-UAV) network to offer organized and secure communication resources and relaying capabilities to soldiers, military vehicles, and assets on the ground in a signal-challenged urban environment. Additionally, we developed a framework for detecting common multiple types of cyberattacks (black hole, gray hole, and jamming) using the Light Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm. However, zero-day attacks are newly developed cyberattacks that can cause significant harm to the functionality of a SD-UAV network. Due to the novelty of these attacks, there is a lack of data samples for ML model training and testing. In order to tackle this problem, this paper provides a predictive queuing analysis of a SD-UAV network. To our knowledge, no previous work has proposed using queuing analysis to predict network performance statistics of SD-UAV networks for the purpose of enhancing security against zero-day cyberattacks. This analysis allows the network operator to calculate the expected theoretical values of the average interarrival time, transmission delay, and packet count of each SD-UAV in a swarm under normal, non-attack operating conditions. This allows the network operator to establish a normal baseline for ML training in order to compare and detect zero-day attacks by detecting any malicious or abnormal SD-UAV network behavior. In this study, we conduct an analysis, simulation, and discussion of the results of our predictive queuing analysis. Our simulation results confirm the accuracy of our predictive queuing analysis we obtained for the average interarrival times, transmission delay, and packet count for the SD-UAVs in the swarm. Our predictive queuing analysis enables the network operator to predict network performance statistics of the SD-UAVs for the purpose of enhancing security against zero-day cyberattacks.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cutting-edge technological advancements, e.g. 3D printers and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), may become high-tech means and implements of offences posing enormous security threats to sustainable urban development. The relevance of the subject matter arises out of the nexus between unrest and urban security as it manifests on two levels, on the one hand, urban planning can contribute to disturbances, and on the other hand, there is an actual threat caused by riots to urban facilities. 3D printers and UAVs can potentially be exploited for tactical purposes, including supplying crowds with 3D-printed weapons, transporting them, and obstructing law enforcement officers. The elimination or minimization of outlined misuses of these tools of the Industry 4.0, augments urban security in a fundamental way. The main result of the study is that the abovementioned tools cannot be asserted as determinants of crime, they only play a peripheral, auxiliary role in the commission of criminal acts. Thus, it is concluded that these instruments do need to be regulated through an intelligent control approach.

	abstract = {Mobile applications have rapidly grown over the past few decades to offer futuristic applications, such as autonomous vehicles, smart farming, and smart city. Such applications require ubiquitous, real-time, and secure communications to deliver services quickly. Toward this aim, sixth-generation (6G) wireless technology offers superior performance with high reliability, enhanced transmission rate, and low latency. However, managing the resources of the aforementioned applications is highly complex in the precarious network. An adversary can perform various network-related attacks (i.e., data injection or modification) to jeopardize the regular operation of the smart applications. Therefore, incorporating blockchain technology in the smart application can be a prominent solution to tackle security, reliability, and data-sharing privacy concerns. Motivated by the same, we presented a case study on public safety applications that utilizes the essential characteristics of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and a 6G network to handle data integrity attacks on the crime data. The case study is assessed using various performance parameters by considering blockchain scalability, packet drop ratio, and training accuracy.

	abstract = {Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) also known as drones are changing the world [1]. Whether it's military, medicine, agriculture, city planning, surveillance, package delivery or sports. These machines are useful in ways that haven't been discovered yet. Making dangerous work safe by putting something between people and potential risks. Increasing the amount of land that can be searched in search and rescues. Drones are making difficult jobs easier. Conversely the danger they pose is also being discovered. Everyday a new danger is presented by the growing number of drones being used, and as we rely more on them the problem grows. This research paper looks into the current security issues that are found in drones and what is being done to lessen the risk that drones pose to countries, businesses, and civilians. Looking to find what works best to protect drones from cyber threats, and how to protect against them. This is done by reading research journals, news articles, watching videos done by professors/news organizations then analyzing the data found. Two frames of mind are used when analyzing the problems found from research. First, will be how to protect the drone from cyber threats. Second will be how to protect from drone cyber attacks. The results of this research found that drones are extremely unsafe against cyber attacks, and are powerful weapons to finding and exploiting holes in a systems defense. Research on defending drones found insufficient authentication, encryption, signal verification, defined access privileges, and threat reporting. These problems exist from hobby pilots to [2]Department of Defense (DOD) drones. The greatest tool a drone has when attacking a system is stealth and mobility. It can attack multiple targets with only a few fly bys. Because of this the best defense against drone cyber threats is detection. Once detected the drone could be dealt with physically or by exploiting security holes commonly found in drones. Resulting from the cybersecurity threat posed both to drones, and from drones [3, 4, 5, 6] laws are being written in multiple countries. These laws are designed to limit their usage or ban them completely. To solve this problem, there are three key steps to eliminating a majority of the threats. [7] Implementing authentication, encryption, and a threat reporting system would allow drones to continue to change the world safely.  © 2022 IEEE.},

It is necessary to establish sophisticated and robust attack detection techniques to defend against security threats as the use of drones becomes increasingly widespread and their applications diversify. This is due to the lack of privacy and security consideration in the drone's system, including an inadequate computation capability and unsecured wireless channels to perform advanced cryptographic algorithms. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anomaly detection systems can identify suspicious activities and monitor network traffic, such as anomalous communication patterns or unauthorized access attempts. Therefore, the study presents an enhanced dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm with deep learning-based attack detection (EDMOA-DLAD) in Networks B5G for the purpose of Drones technique. The presented EDMOA-DLAD technique aims to recognize the attacks and classifies them on the drone network B5G. Primarily, the EDMOA-DLAD technique designs a feature selection (FS) approach using EDMOA. To detect attacks, the EDMOA-DLAD technique uses a deep variational autoencoder (DVAE) classifier. Finally, the EDMOA-DLAD technique applies the beetle antenna search (BAS) technique for the optimum hyperparameter part of DVAE model. The outcome of EDMOA-DLAD approach can be verified on benchmark datasets. A wide range of simulations inferred that the EDMOA-DLAD method obtains enhanced performance of 99.79% over other classification techniques. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Real time monitoring of urban areas and densely populated city centers for criminal activity is a major challenge faced by the police force globally. The interlocking street networks provides a means of escape for criminals and makes it costly and time consuming for law enforcement agencies to track and capture these criminals. Cameras installed in streets and shops provide some form of identification which can be used for tracking but it has a limitation when the criminals are in motion. Helicopters are currently being used by security agencies to provide real time aerial monitoring of urban areas but the cost implications and deployment time of this service are key challenges with this approach. This paper proposes the use of the low power Vertical Takeoff and Landing type Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (VTOL-UAV) as a tool to be deployed for the monitoring of the city centers in the event of emergencies such as disasters and criminal activities. The cities are divided into wide area cells with a VTOL UAV allocated to the cells. Whenever an alert is raised, the closest VTOL UAV is deployed immediately to provide aerial surveillance. The video feeds from the UAV are monitored from the local police department and this information is used to provide guidance to the security agents in pursuit.},

	abstract = {Cities attract a large number of inhabitants due to their more advanced industrial and commercial sectors and more abundant and convenient living conditions. According to statistics, more than half of the world’s population resides in urban areas, contributing to the prosperity of cities. However, it also brings more crime risks to the city. Crime prediction based on spatiotemporal data, along with the implementation of multiple unmanned drone patrols and responses, can effectively reduce a city’s crime rate. This paper utilizes machine learning and data mining techniques, predicts crime incidents in small geographic areas with short timeframes, and proposes a random forest algorithm based on oversampling, which outperforms other prediction algorithms in terms of performance. The research results indicate that the random forest algorithm based on oversampling can effectively predict crimes with an accuracy rate of up to 95%, and an AUC value close to 0.99. Based on the crime prediction results, this paper proposes a multi-drone patrol response strategy to patrol and respond to predicted high-crime areas, which is based on target clustering and combined genetic algorithms. This strategy may help with the pre-warning patrol planning within an hourly range. This paper aims to combine crime event predictions with crowd-sourced cruise responses to proactively identify potential crimes, providing an effective solution to reduce urban crime rates. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The studies of Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) cooperative detection systems have received much attention due to their wide applications in the disaster rescue, target tracking, intelligent surveillance, and automatical package delivery missions. UAVs provide a broad view and have a fast speed in the air, while UGVs have sufficient load capacity and can serve as repeater stations on the ground. The path planning of a UAV/UGV cooperative system is an important but difficult issue, which aims to plan paths for both the UAVs and the UGVs in the system to cooperatively complete a mission. In this article, we consider the path planning problem of the UAV/UGV cooperative system for illegal urban building detection, by taking the limits of UGV speed, UAV load power, and UAV/UGV communication restriction into consideration. To solve this problem, we first model the path planning problem as a constraint optimization problem which tries to minimize an overall execution time for completing the illegal urban building detection tasks, and then propose a two-level memetic algorithm (called Two-MA) to solve the path planning problems of both the UAV and the UGV. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets show the superiority of the proposed Two-MA over several states-of-the-art algorithms in solving the path planning problems of the UAV and UGV for illegal urban building detection tasks. Note to Practitioners - This article was motivated by the task of detecting illegal buildings in cities by unmanned vehicles. Previous works mainly focus on path planning of either UAVs or UGVs in this task. This article proposes a new approach using an Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) cooperative system for detecting illegal buildings in parks, by taking the limits of UGV speed, UAV load power, and UAV/UGV communication restriction into consideration. This cooperative system consists of a UAV, UGV, and control center. The UAV equipped with cameras takes aerial photography in the air, and can transmit collected photos to the control center. The UGV executes loading and transportation on the ground, and can serve as takeoff and landing platforms for the UAV. The control center executes computationally intensive tasks such as data transmission and processing, task scheduling, and vehicle coordination. To quickly complete all detection tasks, a memetic algorithm is proposed for path planning of both the UAV and the UGV. The simulated results show that the proposed algorithm enables the UAV/UGV cooperative system to visit all buildings in cities with a minimum task execution time.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a collaborative design (“co-design”) approach to accelerating public and political acceptance of the cyberspace and information risks, inherent to the development and deployment of indoor smart building unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to provide immediate “visual access” to law enforcement and other armed first responders in the case of an active shooter incident inside of a building, including risks concerning (1) system safety and reliability; (2) supply chain security; (3) cybersecurity; and (4) privacy. The paper explores the potential to use a virtual world platform as part of a phased pilot at the U.S. Service Academies to build trust in the privacy, security and efficacy of a counter active shooter UAS (CAS-UAS), trust necessary to win public and political support for procuring, developing, and deploying such a system. By using a live-virtual-constructive approach similar to the U.S. military’s synthetic training environments (STE), to intentionally engage a cross-functional team in a pilot to field a prototype CAS-UAS, a co-created CAS-UAS could anticipate and address security and privacy concerns of the sort that slowed the roll-out of police body-worn cameras (BWC) and wide area motion imagery (WAMI), particularly in the context of privacy concerns over the use of facial recognition. The paper is intended to provide communities with a new approach to identify and address policy obstacles to deploying smart city IoT technology to save lives, here in the case of a CAS-UAS that can enhance situational awareness for first responders during active shootings inside of public buildings like shopping malls, corporate headquarters, houses of worship or schools.

	abstract = {The recent decline in the number of police and security force personnel has raised a serious security issue that could lead to reduced public safety and delayed response to crimes in urban areas. This may be alleviated in part by utilizing micro or small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their high-mobility on-board sensors in conjunction with machine-learning techniques such as neural networks to offer better performance in predicting times and places that are high-risk and deterring crimes. The key to the success of such operation lies in the suitable placement of UAVs. This paper proposes a multi-UAV allocation framework for predictive crime deterrence and data acquisition that consists of the overarching methodology, a problem formulation, and an allocation method that work with a prediction model using a machine learning approach. In contrast to previous studies, our framework provides the most effective arrangement of UAVs for maximizing the chance to apprehend offenders whilst also acquiring data that will help improve the performance of subsequent crime prediction. This paper presents the system architecture assumed in this study, followed by a detailed description of the methodology, the formulation of the problem, and the UAV allocation method of the proposed framework. Our framework is tested using a real-world crime dataset to evaluate its performance with respect to the expected number of crimes deterred by the UAV patrol. Furthermore, to address the engineering practice of the proposed framework, we discuss the feasibility of the simulated deployment scenario in terms of energy consumption and the relationship between data analysis and crime prediction. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of market economy and the continuous improvement of urbanization process in China, housing construction in almost all areas of densely populated cities has shown explosive growth. The existence of illegal construction, to a certain extent, not only causes the waste of land and resources, but also leads to the increase of the cost of the development of affordable housing, but also increases the security risks. It is urgent to solve the common problem of urban disease in violation of construction, but the conventional means of monitoring illegal construction mainly rely on on on-site inspection by law enforcement departments and mass reporting. Due to the limited inspection power and time, there are inevitably omissions. At the same time, there are difficulties in obtaining evidence in violation of construction investigation. Therefore, a new type of monitoring method is urgently needed. There is a wide market demand in China's urban management departments and land and resources departments for automated monitoring methods to reduce the cost of urban management. In this paper, urban spatial geographic information is acquired by means of remote sensing change detection, and compared with urban construction land planning approval data, including illegal matching recognition algorithm. Based on the technology of automatic urban change detection of grid image blocks, an efficient algorithm for building change detection is proposed. Establish a threshold recognition and accuracy test algorithm of urban building construction progress model parameters, and obtain information of illegal building construction progress and area based on grid image blocks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to identify and extract buildings from satellite remote sensing images in different time periods. The dynamic change information of the research area is reflected by multi-source and large data integration technology of satellite and UAV remote sensing. Several optical image sample sets and test sets are established. The convolution neural network model is designed by sample sets. The accuracy and sensitivity of illegal identification can be improved by the combination of AI and in-depth learning. Using the method of monitoring, analyzing and comparing the big data of urban construction to monitor the illegal buildings in cities is not only fast and efficient, but also provides a scientific and objective basis for the relevant departments to enforce the law. © 2020 B.

	abstract = {The smart city concept has attracted high research attention in recent years within diverse application domains, such as crime suspect identification, border security, transportation, aerospace, and so on. Specific focus has been on increased automation using data driven approaches, while leveraging remote sensing and real-time streaming of heterogenous data from various resources, including unmanned aerial vehicles, surveillance cameras, and low-earth-orbit satellites. One of the core challenges in exploitation of such high temporal data streams, specifically videos, is the trade-off between the quality of video streaming and limited transmission bandwidth. An optimal compromise is needed between video quality and subsequently, recognition and understanding and efficient processing of large amounts of video data. This research proposes a novel unified approach to lossy and lossless video frame compression, which is beneficial for the autonomous processing and enhanced representation of high-resolution video data in various domains. The proposed fast block matching motion estimation technique, namely mean predictive block matching, is based on the principle that general motion in any video frame is usually coherent. This coherent nature of the video frames dictates a high probability of a macroblock having the same direction of motion as the macroblocks surrounding it. The technique employs the partial distortion elimination algorithm to condense the exploration time, where partial summation of the matching distortion between the current macroblock and its contender ones will be used, when the matching distortion surpasses the current lowest error. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art techniques, including the four step search, three step search, diamond search, and new three step search. © 2020 by the authors.

With the increase in the amount of UAVs in the sky, the need for the UAV traffic management arises. Unmanned air traffic management system (UTMS), especially in the urban airspace, could be considered as a critical infrastructure, which - if disrupted - can lead to severe monetary losses and even casualties. As a computerized system, UTMS is susceptible to cyber attacks ranging from cyber vandalism to cyber warfare. This work considers cyber threats to the UTMS, and how it should be designed in order to be resilient to these threats. The work was performed as a part of the early design of an urban UTMS in Singapore; however, the findings are applicable to designing UTMS for any urban environment. © 2017 IEEE.},

Whilst many commercial providers have followed the traditional path of employing dedicated enforcement officers to pilot the drones, in this paper we present on-going research that 'gamifies' the enforcment activities to allow members of the local community to act as enforcement officers. In particular we have worked with retired members of the police and armed services as drone pilots in relation to the enforcement of by-laws relating to parking offences and dog fouling in a small UK city. The initial results indicate that not only does this age group find the game-like activity enjoyable they feel that they are providing an important service to their community. © Copyright 2015 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

	abstract = {With the rapid expansion in the number of Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) available and the development of modern technologies, the commercial applications of UAVs in urban areas, such as urban remote sensing (RS), express services, urban road traffic monitoring, urban police security, urban air shows and so on, have increased greatly. However, most UAVs, especially light and small civil UAVs, have been operating in low-altitude airspace, and a conflict may exist between increasing the number of UAVs and the limited low airspace. To promote low-altitude airspace resource development and to standardize the operation and management of UAVs in urban regions, some global laws and regulations and key technologies for urban low-altitude applications of UAVs have been implemented. This paper reviews the development of current policies and key technologies concerning safe and efficient operations of the light-and-small civil UAVs in low altitude in urban areas. Discussions are made progressively on measures and methods of airspace restriction, airspace structuring and air route planning in China primarily and the rest of world. After surveying the practical industry tests and the initial studies of air routes, the survey results indicate that the construction of air route networks is a scientific and effective measure to standardize and improve the efficiency of low-altitude UAV operations. From the view point of safety and efficiency, the most valuable direction for UAV regulation in urban regions involves deepening the research which largely relies on urban RS and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, and application demonstrations of low-altitude public air route networks. © 2013 IEEE.},

The development covers the conceptual application, the UAV applicable rules by the Aeronautical Agency in Brazil (ANAC) and the manufacturing of customized equipment, in this case a quadcopter UAV platform customized to fly over urban regions indoors and outdoors. The application development was made considering the operational necessities of the Police of the State of São Paulo - Brazil. Some of these applications required air supremacy with limited resources or by the lack of resources (helicopters), and to fly over dangerous places, such as slums. The tactical surveillance, relay of communication, territorial monitoring, environmental mapping, C2 and ISR applications require specific sensors embedded in the aircraft which can be modified depending on the type of mission performed. The integration of each sensor and data processing are done inside of UAV, using a specific board and running as a complementary device, defined as payload control board. Processing some data onboard allows to reduce the telemetry throughput, for sample actions for the gimbal control, image processing and indoor navigation system with avoid obstacle. The UAV can also be connected in parallel to various locations where information is transmitted and sent in real time. This ensures that the situation is evaluated by different individuals to help make the correct decision. Since the employment of this system in 2015, it has proved to be efficient in real missions, such as in drug combats, aerial mapping of farms, forests, and slums, and also helped in pests combat - Dengue. This gave the Police in Brazil aerial supremacy over urban regions. © 2018 IEEE.},

Aerial vehicles deployed in such cluttered environments are required to have robust autonomous navigation with both target tracking and obstacle avoidance capabilities. To this end, this work presents a simple-to-design but effective steerable sensor platform and its implementation techniques for both obstacle avoidance and target tracking. The proposed platform is a 2-axis gimbal system capable of roll and pitch/yaw. The mathematical model that governs the dynamics of this platform is developed. The performance of the platform is validated through a software-in-the-loop simulation. The simulation results show that the platform can be effectively steered to all regions of interest except backward. With its design layout and mount location, the platform can engage sensors for obstacle avoidance and target tracking as per requirements. Moreover, steering the platform in any direction does not induce aerodynamic instability on the unmanned aerial vehicle in mission. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Our study examines the effects of local-level urban layout on crime incidence in Coral Gables, a planned, higher-income area in Miami-Dade County, Florida. We assess key environmental attributes, including streetlights, layout, and sidewalks. Our analysis incorporates crime data, UAV orthophotos, and site-specific factors [e.g., streetlight illumination and sidewalk accessibility] to reveal spatiotemporal crime patterns. These patterns exhibit clustering and spatial unevenness. Neighborhood variability, including walkable, accessible neighborhoods, water barriers, gated community seclusion, and perimeter zones bordering lower-income and mixed-use development, influences crime distribution. The impact of streetlights varied across the city, with greater illumination, particularly from residential areas, acting as a significant deterrent against criminal activity. The northern area of Coral Gables aligns with higher crime concentration. Sidewalk accessibility affects crime rates, highlighting the importance of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Multi-residential buildings exhibit higher crime rates. Our findings underscore the significance of thoughtful urban planning and granular insights into micro-spatial patterns, which can inform targeted safety enhancements within specific neighborhood locations. Based on the current crime landscape in Coral Gables, we identify exciting avenues for future research with practical implications for crime prevention. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Systems UAS, i.e. drones, revolutionize the market for mobility based services and enable more efficient defence and security operations. Also this rapidly developing technology, however, proves to be Janus-faced. Despite their unquestionable benefits, UAS increasingly pose serious safety and security threats. Detection, tracking, and classification of small and highly agile drones, however, is one of the most challenging surveillance tasks. Only a properly designed suite of heterogeneous and mutually complementary sensor provides the required sensor data. On this basis, the key technology proves to advanced multiple sensor data fusion that provides situational awareness and the key information for assigning appropriate counter measures. We in particular focus on a novel approach and highly promising approach which has the potential of a paradigm shift in sensor data fusion: Tensor decomposition based multiple sensor tracking filters. This new methodology for fusion engines is able to efficiently represent the full informational content of advanced sensors and sophisticated dynamic models for drone motion. Powerful multilinear decomposition methods for tensors are drastically reducing the computational efforts for producing high-quality tracks for dim and agile drones. Moreover, the deterministic performance characteristics of tensor decomposition based fusion have beneficial implications for systems design aspects. These advanced algorithms of multiple sensor data fusion play a key role in designing counter drone systems. In the context of C5ISR systems (Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), the technological challenges can be met, but require close cooperation between the military and police forces, research institutes and the relevant industries. In the protection of stationary equipment and mobile units in urban or open terrain, the integration of drone detection / tracking / classification in decision support systems is crucial. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

	abstract = {Over the last century, the development of the aviation industry has fundamentally changed the way we live, work, and travel, and aviation has not stopped innovating during this time. In the last few years, new types of aircraft have started to be developed, including Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS or drones) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft. With the development of these new aircraft types, aviation is once again taking a significant step forward. UAM refers to an ecosystem that enables on-demand, highly automated, passenger or cargo-carrying air transport services, with particular reference to the urban and sub-urban environments, where aviation is often highly regulated today. The UAM industry’s vision involves new vehicle designs, new system technologies, the development of new airspace management constructs, new operational procedures and shared services to enable an innovative type of transport network. The CORUS-XUAM research project demonstrated how U-space services and solutions could support integrated UAM flight operations, allowing air taxis, drones and other airspace users (unmanned and manned) to operate safely, securely, sustainably and efficiently in a controlled and fully integrated airspace, without undue impact on operations currently managed by air traffic management (ATM). The project was undertaken by the consortium that delivered the SESAR JU-funded CORUS U-space Concept of Operations (ConOps) in 2019, extended by the addition of UAM expertise. CORUS-XUAM activities started with updating of the U-space ConOps, addressing the integration of UAM and drone operations into the airspace, as well as identifying new U-space-phase U3 and U4 services. The project’s activities then continued with the preparation and execution of six challenging Very Large Scale Demonstration (VLD) campaigns in Belgium, France, Germany/UK, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. These VLD activities were the core of the CORUS-XUAM project. They demonstrated integrated UAM, drone and manned aircraft operations, through advanced forms of interaction using digital data exchange, supported by integrated and advanced U-space services in urban, sub-urban, and inter-city scenarios, as well as in and near ATM-controlled airspaces and airports. The VLDs focused on different types of mission, such as passenger transport, logistics, delivery, emergency response and surveillance, using different U-space deployment architectures and state-of-the-art technologies. They considered coordination between ATC (Air Traffic Control) and U-space, including interaction with air-traffic controllers and pilots. The VLDs combined flights by air taxis with other traffic and operations in the control zones (CTR) of major airports. Vertiport procedures, separation, and data services were also demonstrated. In the specific this paper provides information about the Very Large Demonstration executed in Italy. The Italian demonstration, focused on guidelines for safe depot-to-depot operations between two logistics centres within a suburban area. Flight tests, with involvement of a fast UAM vehicle and other drones for operations, took place at Grottaglie-Taranto civil airport in the framework of Grottaglie Airport Test Bed, allowing the involvement of an ATM component and the demonstration of coordination and interoperability between ATM and U-space for the management of UAM cargo traffic. This VLD addressed the UAM-tailored performance framework developed in CORUS-XUAM, including safety, access and equity, cyber security and human performance, measured through human-in-the-loop assessment, such as ATCOs and pilots and analysis of data collected during the demonstration. In detail the scenario, was composed by three different macro area located in Apulia Region (South-East of Italy) :• Grottaglie-Taranto Civil Airport • Manduria Airfield • Urban Area: Hospital The type of operation was identified as a medical cargo transportation. The demonstration saw the participation and involvement of different actors, vehicles, systems and facilities and was composed by the following phases: Phase 1: UAM medical cargo operation in U-space with other UAS Phase 2: BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line Of Sight) small cargo operation from suburban to urban area Phase 3: Management of emergency from ATM in U-space: HEMS flight with high priority In detail the demo was composed by the following steps: • A cargo (e.g. medical goods) arrived at Taranto-Grottaglie Civil airport. • The medical content was loaded on a Pipistrel (PVS) Large Fixed Wing Cargo UAS/RPAS placed in an area close to the airport. • The PVS aircraft started the mission and flew in U-space through a dedicated UAM corridor in VLL (Very low level Airspace) which ended in an area (logistic center) close to Manduria. • During the flight other drone operations (photogrammetry, precision agriculture) were performed and managed in the U-space. • Once the PVS a/c landed on the airfield, the medical load was divided into several smaller loads. • One of these was loaded on a Techno Sky UAS and transported to final destination (Manduria city area near hospital) through a specific BVLOS operation of 7km. • Before the return flight to Grottaglie Airport of the PVS (before take-off), an emergency occurred (an HEMS flight started in controlled airspace and executed operation in U-space). The emergency was managed at all levels. • A commercial Drone Detection system was also used for detection of non-cooperative drones and related information were integrated into d-flight USSP (U-space Service Provider) platform. • The following U-space services were used and applied during the demo: Network identification service, geoawareness, traffic information, flight authorization The Italian demonstration confirmed that the U-space services tested are largely ready for emergency transport services and operations with drones in peri-urban and urban areas, regardless of the size of the drones used (UAM cargo drone vs small drone if appropriately authorized for operations). The demonstration has also allowed to further investigate the U-space services and to collect valuable feedback for the subsequent industrialization phase. The experience in ATM and U-space acquired will contribute significantly to the definition of the European UAM operating concept, demonstrating its applicability in the Italian context and ensuring its correspondence with national interests and business strategies. The main results of CORUS-XUAM were used to consolidate the ConOps at the end of the project. The project also involved extensive consultation and communication initiatives involving authorities, U-space stakeholders and end-users. Innovative ATM/U-space services and the development of smart, automated, interoperable, and sustainable traffic management solutions are the key enablers for achieving the high level of integration needed to make urban air mobility a reality. These challenging objectives can only be achieved through an evolutionary development process ensuring the definition and timely deployment of appropriate, advanced and interoperable ATM/U-space infrastructure, technology, and traffic management capabilities, providing advanced services that fit with expected types of operation and levels of demand. © 2024, International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences.

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is key for large scale monitoring of urban and suburban areas with high revisit time and spatial resolution. However, in some applications involving targets characterized by limited extension and unknown spectral response and spatial distribution, data acquired from space could be insufficient. This is the case of micro-dumps mapping, which represent a highly diffuse environmental hazard in Southern Italy and, in general, in many suburban areas all around the world. Their intrinsic heterogeneity hampers the usage of descriptors based on the spectral response of the targets. The limited extension makes it imaged in few pixels, even using very high-resolution data. In such cases, the exploitation of proximal sensing becomes fundamental. This paper presents a new architecture for real-time characterization of illegal micro-dumps. It is composed, at hardware level, by a customized remotely piloted aerial platform equipped with an innovative payload able to deliver the necessary data for online three-dimensional processing. In particular, a depth camera coupled with a tracking sensor and the drone autopilot (connected with a GPS receiver) is exploited to retrieve a sparse point-cloud, which is geo-localized thanks to positioning information provided by a sensor fusion algorithm. The software component is designed to synchronize, align, segment and extract a volume estimate from the available point cloud with a real time processing. Experimental results show that the developed system is able to deliver accurate volume estimates compared to manual measurements and values obtained via classic offline structure from motion techniques.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G are enabling intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). ITSs promise to improve road safety in smart cities. Therefore, ITSs are gaining earnest devotion in the industry as well as in academics. Due to the rapid increase in population, vehicle numbers are increasing, resulting in a large number of road accidents. The majority of the time, casualties are not appropriately discovered and reported to hospitals and relatives. This lack of rapid care and first aid might result in life loss in a matter of minutes. To address all of these challenges, an intelligent system is necessary. Although several information communication technologies (ICT)-based solutions for accident detection and rescue operations have been proposed, these solutions are not compatible with all vehicles and are also costly. Therefore, we proposed a reporting and accident detection system (RAD) for a smart city that is compatible with any vehicle and less expensive. Our strategy aims to improve the transportation system at a low cost. In this context, we developed an android application that collects data related to sound, gravitational force, pressure, speed, and location of the accident from the smartphone. The value of speed helps to improve the accident detection accuracy. The collected information is further processed for accident identification. Additionally, a navigation system is designed to inform the relatives, police station, and the nearest hospital. The hospital dispatches UAV (i.e., drone with first aid box) and ambulance to the accident spot. The actual dataset from the Road Safety Open Repository is used for results generation through simulation. The proposed scheme shows promising results in terms of accuracy and response time as compared to existing techniques. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In remote sensing image processing, the rapid monitoring of urban illegal buildings or illegal occupations by remote sensing image change detection is efficient for obtaining urban geographic spatial information. In addition, the change detection has become a hot topic in the field of remote sensing, and has been widely used in various fields such as medicine, military and geographic information. Therefore, it is important to study the change detection algorithm based on remote sensing image registration. During the image acquisition by small unmanned aerial vehicles, due to the influence of the aircraft posture, height, speed and other factors, a series of problems can result in the acquired remote sensing image, such as extrusion, distortion, stretching, offset and overlap with respect to the interest targets. The key steps of change detection are image registration, whose performance can affect the results of change detection. This paper processes the image through the optimization of the low-altitude remote sensing image registration algorithm to obtain specific information of the building distribution. In addition, the paper analyzes the difference information for the low-altitude remote sensing image that has been registered. The experimental test results prove that the method is robust. © 2022 SPIE},

Due to compute/network resource demands in video processing in a reliable and scalable manner to enable situational awareness for application consumers of video feeds, these systems need to rely on network services, edge computing devices and cloud infrastructure resources. Consequently, there is a need for effective integration of point-solutions that can transmit information from the system edge to the cloud platforms. In this paper, we present a novel framework viz., TIGER (Transmitting Information with Global-designation of Emergency Routes) that leverages the merits of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4) to provide intelligent network services. Specifically, TIGER framework comprises two network services 'priority routing' and 'congestion control' that distinguish emergency traffic transmission based on source-based routing, and select congestion-free links based on multi-hop routing inspection as network cross-traffic increases, respectively. Our experiment results show that TIGER framework achieves priority routing by reducing packet jitter by 52%, corresponding to robust real-time data transmission. In addition, it achieves congestion control through traffic reduction by 45% across multiple pathways. © 2023 IEEE.},

Urban residents frequently inform authorities of illegal roofs, a type of illegal structure, because of the potential fire hazards they pose. However, the government does not conduct timely inspection on illegal roofs because this process requires additional human resources. Therefore, developing an efficient and correct method for inspecting and reporting illegal structures is necessary. In this study, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were used to rapidly capture images, which were then used to generate orthophotos, a 3D building model, a digital surface model (DSM), and a data set containing 400 images of illegal roofs and 400 images of legal roofs. The data set was then used in a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train and evaluate image classification. The results revealed an illegal roof classification accuracy of 96.0%, with a loss of 0.09. In addition, You Only Look Once v3 (YOLOv3) was used to detect illegal buildings, and DSMs higher than 9 m were overlaid to improve the accuracy of the illegal roof identification model. Overall, the study results can help inspectors build a comprehensive database of illegal roofs, which can serve as a reference for budgeting demolition costs and human resources. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Monitoring techniques with high precision and efficiency are vital to prevent the accidents and reduce losses, and UAV has great potential and advantages to conduct such task compared to human daily inspection. To quickly get the illegal operation information from UAV image, a method of change detection based on elevation difference and local binary pattern (LBP) is proposed to monitor the land surface along subway by unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing (UAVRS). After accurate registrations without GCPs complete, the two DSMs and DOMS are mutually matched by the same points in their own model. Gaussian smoothing is used in gray-scale map to eliminating noise jamming before making change detection based on elevation difference. Pix4D is used to generate 2 DSMs of the study area, and texture feature is measured by LBP which is advanced in its rotational invariance and brightness invariance. Comparing with former researches, two DSMs are matched by invariant points in their own models instead of GCPs which are usually collected by GPS, with the registration precision less than 0.1m both in XY and Z directions, which meets the requirement of illegal operation detection in subway safety monitoring, and the adoption of LBP works well for images collected in different climate and illumination. © 2018 SPIE.},

	abstract = {The rapid integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into smart city infrastructures necessitates advanced security measures to ensure their safe and sustainable operation. However, existing Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) systems are highly vulnerable to spoofing, data falsification, and cyber threats, which compromises air traffic management and poses significant challenges to UAV security. This paper presents an innovative approach to improving UAV security by introducing a novel steganographic method for ADS-B data protection. The proposed method leverages Fourier transformation to embed UAV identifiers into ADS-B signals, ensuring a high level of concealment and robustness against signal distortions. A key feature of the approach is the dynamic parameter management system, which adapts to varying transmission conditions to minimize distortions and enhance resilience. Experimental validation demonstrates that the method achieves a tenfold reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) compared to existing techniques such as mp3stego while also improving the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) compared to s-tools. The proposed solution ensures compliance with existing ADS-B standards, maintaining seamless integration with air traffic management systems while enhancing cybersecurity measures. By safeguarding UAV communications, the method contributes to the sustainable development of smart cities and supports critical applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and emergency response operations. These findings confirm the practical feasibility of the proposed approach and its potential to strengthen UAV security and ADS-B data protection, ultimately contributing to the resilience and sustainability of urban airspace infrastructure. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has gained increased attention for improving the performance and efficiency of the fifth-generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless communication by obviating the propagation and blockage issues. On the other hand, the great flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has made them effective gadgets to enhance the coverage of wireless communication networks. Combining these two emerging technologies, the RIS-outfitted UAV (RISoUAV) is a promising solution for providing line-of-sight (LoS) wireless links for mobile targets (MTs) in obstructed high-dense urban areas. In this light, high-speed real-Time communication is essential for some vital municipal services like ambulances, fire engines, security guards, police, etc. This important goal is achievable thanks to the RISoUAV-Assisted 5G/quasi-optic wireless communication. This paper develops a framework for optimal navigation of a team of RISoUAVs for maintaining LoS links with a team of ground vehicles in a dense urban area. The trajectories of the RISoUAVs are optimized considering the energy efficiency, communication channel gains, and constraints associated with RISoUAVs motion and LoS service. A consensus-based coordinating approach is adopted to coordinate the RISoUAVs navigation to cover all MTs under a good quality of service. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, we consider a scenario where vehicles need to have high-speed, uninterrupted data links in obstructed, highly dense urban environments. Due to spectrum crunch, the data links are increasingly likely to rely on a high-frequency spectrum, including mmWave with quasi-optic nature, visible light communications, or even laser. However, the obstructed LoS and propagation are critical issues with the 5G and beyond as they rely on the availability of an unobstructed path (e.g., the LoS or a quality reflective path). On the other hand, the RIS performs as a passive reflective element that provides an indirect LoS link, a one-bounce channel, to improve the performance and efficiency of mmWave, and beyond, wireless communication networks. UAVs equipped with RISs are suggested in this paper to be adopted as aerial transponders to reflect signals and facilitate communication in high-density environments. Therefore, the problem of UAV navigation and 3D trajectory planning should be addressed regarding the application, particularly, for providing LoS service for mobile vehicles with arbitrary directions. Autonomous navigation of RISoUAVs for LoS wireless communication is a natural multi-dimensional extension of autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance where regions in which LoS communication is lost are viewed as obstacles to avoid. However, the environment and valid LoS links can change dynamically due to moving vehicles in the obstructed environment. This makes the navigation design an NP-hard problem that is tackled in this paper by developing an effective navigation program.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A NATO air strike killed 24 Pakistani Army members who were patrolling the Afghanistan border with Pakistan, and, although the US use of drones in Pakistan have been controversial, this latest incident enraged and inflamed public and political opinion in Pakistan as thousands of people protested across Pakistani cities as well as media channels using solemn music to portray the soldiers as martyrs massacred in the interests of the US. The incident has arguably fuelled anti-US/UK sentiments which do not make it easier for the Pakistani police service, already struggling with strategic, resource and geographic challenges, to counter the threat from terrorist groups. In the fight against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, such incidents will only add to the antipathy and propaganda used by those organisations to play upon disaffected Pakistani's and use such moments as a recruitment tool both in the UK and in Pakistan. In light of this, it is important to explore and examine the repercussions upon law enforcement agencies such as the Pakistani police and the methods which they have to employ in combating and dealing with terror threats, since those operations will have a direct impact in Britain. In an age of terror, the Pakistani police force must adopt a more focused community policing model that will help tackle such developing terrorist ideologies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {The impact of post-‘9/11’ terrorism on how the city of London has been reimagined is significant. In this paper, we will explore two post-‘9/11’ novels, Chris Cleave’s 2005 Incendiary and Mohsin Hamid’s 2017 Exit West, which complicate the tradition of British literature featuring terrorists (Taylor, London's Burning: Pulp Fiction, the Politics of Terrorism and the Destruction of the Capital in British Popular Culture, 1840–2005 (London: Continuum, 2012), 1–2) by reenvisaging London as a nexus of state terrorism. Incendiary, published on the day of the ‘7/7’ bombings, highlights the complexity of political violence through the story of a traumatised woman who loses her son and husband during a terrorist attack in London. Cleave critiques the post ‘9/11’ city by constructing a narrative centred on the Londoners’ response to the terror perpetrated by the government, the police, and media (e.g.: violence against civilians, suspension of civil rights, martial law, and surveillance). Similarly, Hamid’s Exit West depicts London as a place where refugees live in terror, exploited in work camps and subjected to surveillance (through drones and by citizens turned vigilantes) by the British state. This paper aims to interrogate how these texts problematise mainstream representations of sovereign power in London. If state sovereignty is understood as ‘an aspiration that seeks to create itself in the face of internally fragmented, unevenly distributed and unpredictable configurations of political authority that exercise more or less legitimate violence in a territory’ (T. B. Hansen and F. Stepputat (eds.), Sovereign Bodies: Citizens, Migrants and States in the Postcolonial World (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. 2005), 10), literary fiction creates a space suitable for questioning the legitimacy of this aspiration. The state actively produces ‘fear, terror, and violence’, embedding in the construction of cities (D. Gregory, The Colonial Present (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2004), 4). The London of Cleave’s and Hamid’s novels becomes a site for both projecting terrorism and resisting terror in all its forms. Our interdisciplinary theoretical framework combines postcolonial theory and elements of urban and cultural sociology (S. Graham (ed.), Cities, War, and Terrorism: Towards an Urban Geopolitics (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2004); S. Graham, Cities Under Siege: The New Military Urbanism (London: Verso, 2011); J. C. Alexander, Performance and Power (Cambridge: Polity, 2011)) with inquiries into the cultural imaginary of terrorism (Frank, The Cultural Imaginary of Terrorism in Public Discourse, Literature, and Film: Narrating Terror (New York, NY: Routledge, 2017), 75.) in post-‘9/11’ literature. We subscribe to the proposition that the ‘only real solution to our current geopolitical crisis’ is asserting the global values that connect the Self with the Other (Gauthier, 9/11 Fiction, Empathy, and Otherness (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2015), 1.) and we argue that Incendiary and Exit West provide a counternarrative to the dominant discourse of terrorism post ‘9/11’, which champions the state’s supreme authority through stereotyping and polarisation. The proposed reading of Cleave’s and Hamid’s novels will show how the city of London, as imagined in literary responses to ‘9/11’, can crystallise a counternarrative of protest by revealing the systemic violence through which sovereign power is performed at the expense of civil populations, particularly minoritised populations through discourses of hate such as Islamophobia and antiimmigrant/refugee rhetoric. © 2019, © The London Journal Trust 2019.},

	abstract = {Crime is heterogeneously distributed and occurs at the most vulnerable places. Crime occurs under poor surveillance and safety, due to lack of public protection and results in damage to public property or human life, and creates a public discrepancy in that particular location. Crime is disastrous because of its unpredictability and unpreparedness for enforcement officers. Finding the probability of occurrence of crimes within such vulnerabilities will help us to deploy certain countermeasures to reduce crime. Crime is limited to location and place. Geographically crime can be considered as a function of lack of surveillance, delay in mobility and control, and probably hidden escape paths utilized by criminals. In this research, a Spatio-Statistical Model was developed for probability-based Crime Prediction using past data and location intelligence technology. Neighborhood Analysis was performed to evaluate the clustering distance between individual crime occurrences within Vadodara city and individual police stations in the neighborhood. The spatial distance is converted into Geographical Coordinate System to calculate latitudinal and longitudinal extents of crime zones in each taluka of the city, which is then utilized to create the Interpolated probability raster for each crime zone with a pixel value equivalent to the probability of occurrence of crime in that location. The Inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation technique generated an interpolated surface which was then represented spatially with quantile divisions to form probability zones with the adjoining nearest police jurisdiction. This will enable law enforcement officers to make probability-based surveillance decisions while incorporating the past data intelligence, time of occurrence of crime, and make efficient serviceable patrolling routes and improve crime control with minimal resources. Using this model, the police officers will be able to create patrol routes based on time and zone of highest probability of crime, to ensure safety. The time-based probability of crime is also calculated using the Bayesian probability formula to get the peak crime hours so that surveillance need to be increased at the appropriate time. UAVs mounted with thermal vision can be deployed in the generated high probability zones at the highest probable time of the crime, to monitor the situation aerially without alarming the criminals. In this research it is created an open-source pixel-based route selection algorithm that could identify hotspot locations of crime so that law enforcement officers can watch human movements and follow them silently using UAV’s thermal camera in nighttime also to obtain their hideouts and catch criminals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In Seattle, the police obtained a surveillance drone with the approval of a city council that did not realize what it was doing. In Oakland, following a council review that lasted literally two minutes, the city created a data integration center that networked together all of its existing surveillance infrastructure. In San Diego, elected representatives were only dimly aware that the law enforcement agency they supervised had built and deployed innovative facial recognition technology. In an age of heightened concern about the militarization of local police and surveillance technology, how do local law enforcement agencies obtain cutting edge and potentially intrusive surveillance equipment without elected leaders and the general public realizing it? The answer lies in the process of federal procurement, through which the federal government, often in the name of combatting terrorism, funnels billions of dollars to local law enforcement agencies that can then be used to purchase surveillance equipment. But the federal government does not take steps to ensure that local elected representatives and members of the public are involved in decisions about what technologies to acquire, or that anyone develops a protocol to constrain how the technologies are used. Surveillance policy making by procurement thus raises a host of questions about accountability for policy choices when the federal government influences local policing through grants, but does not address all relevant concerns and how to deal with the inevitable spillover effects of the federal government’s national security initiatives on the ways local law enforcement agents carry out their more routine policing functions. This Article is the first to comprehensively consider the intersection of procurement and local surveillance policy making. Using case studies from Seattle, Oakland, and San Diego, it exposes the practice of surveillance policy making by procurement. The case studies highlight the structural and institutional factors that lead to surveillance policy making by procurement, and elected representatives’ responses to it point the way towards policy solutions that would bring a greater measure of transparency and accountability to local surveillance policy making. The case studies also provide fodder for thinking through the way federal spending programs can generate confusion over who is responsible for policy choices and how the federal government’s national security policies have spillover effects on the conduct of routine policing. Local communities vary greatly in their crime rates, the competence and trustworthiness of their police departments, and their political convictions. This Article draws on the case studies to suggest that local governments have a valuable role to play in tailoring surveillance policy to local conditions. It concludes by proposing politically feasible steps to strengthen local democratic input regarding what surveillance technology should be adopted and the conditions under which it should be deployed. © 2016, University of Washington School of Law.

The algorithm uses Bayesian analysis to differentiate between street and background pixels. The color profile of edges on the detected street is used to represent objects with respect to their surroundings. These color profiles are used to improve street detection over time. Pixels that do not likely originate from the "true" street are excluded from the recurring Bayesian estimation in the video. Results are presented comparing to a previously published Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) road detection algorithm. Robust performance is demonstrated with urban surveillance scenes including UAV surveillance, police chases from helicopters, and traffic monitoring. The proposed method is shown to be robust to data uncertainty and has low sensitivity to the training dataset. Performance is computed using a challenging multi-site dataset that includes compression artifacts, poor resolution, and large variation of scene complexity., © 2009 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Situation awareness in complex urban environments is an important component for a successful task fulfillment both in military and civil area of applications. In the first area, the fields of deployment of the members of the North Atlantic Alliance have been changed, in the past two decades, from the originally assigned task of acting as national and allied defense forces within the partners' own borders to out-of-area missions under conditions of an asymmetric conflict. Because of its complicated structure, urban terrain represents a particular difficulty of military missions such as patrolling. In the civil field of applications, police and rescue forces are also often strongly dependent on a local visibility and accessibility analysis. However, the process of decision-taking within a short time and under enormous pressure can be extensively trained in an environment that is tailored to the concrete situation. The contribution of this work consists of context-based modeling of urban terrain that can be then integrated into simulation software, for example, Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS2). The input of our procedure is made up by the airborne sensor data, collected either by an active or a passive sensor. The latter is particularly important if the application is time-critical or the area to be explored is small. After description of our procedure for urban terrain modeling with a detailed focus on the recent innovations, the main steps of model integration into simulation software will be presented and two examples of missions for military and civil applications that can be easily created with VBS2 will be given. © 2012 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Remotely operated vehicle systems, ground and air, have great potential for supporting law enforcement operations. These systems, with their onboard sensors, can assist in collecting evidence, performing long term surveillance or in assessing hazardous situations prior to committing personnel. Remote ground vehicles are presently used by many police departments for ordnance clearing missions. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) typically offer long endurance, and are intuitive to operate but can be severely limited in where they can go by terrain and obstacles. Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) have three-dimensional mobility but have landing and takeoff restrictions, mission time limitations, and typically are demanding to operate. A new capability has been demonstrated for the U.S. military that shows great promise for aiding police agencies. This concept uses a shrouded rotor, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), unmanned air vehicle to provide mobility to sensors and other payloads. This system can either perform surveillance from the air or travel to a remote location and land to position onboard sensors to perform long term surveillance from the ground. This mobility platform concept can also be used to position packages (e.g., communications repeaters) or deliver and deploy non-lethal agents. This paper presents the concept of a small, UAV, VTOL, sensor mobility system for support of law enforcement operations. It then discusses operational feasibility and briefly reviews demonstrations of surveillance and sensor placement operations in military urban terrain scenarios performed by the Space and Naval Warfare (SPAWAR) Systems Center San Diego (SSC-SD) and Sikorsky Aircraft with their full size Cypher UAV. We then discuss the practicality of reducing the size of this capability to a system small enough to be transported in standard police vehicles and which can easily be operated by law enforcement personnel. © 1999 Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.
